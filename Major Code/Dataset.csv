OnePlus 7T,1,Dont purchase and use One plus mobile - Files get Corrupt,"I have bought One plus 7T mobile 3 months before. While I was working in offline suddenly the mobile got switched off and showing that the device got corrupt. I have visited nearby oneplus service center in Coimbatore. They told that the data got erased and need to install the software for further use. But after attempting to install the software, the hardware didnt accept the installation. They said to change the motherboard worth Rs.21000/- See the worth of the mobile is Rs.38000/-. What is the use in using this repaired mobile. Very worst experience I faced using the One plus mobile.

OnePlus 7T,3,overly hyped,"I think it is most overly hyped device present in the market.
I was an iPhone user and was looking for a phone of price range 30-40k.
i was searching from a month to buy a decent phone so after watching number of videos about the phone i decided to buy OnePlus 7t. i used it for 3-4 days and sold it on OLX for the loss of 4000. The experience was very bad.
I thing i want to tell you please don't go by specifications, they are making fool. i will tell my point by point.
Display- They says Fluid amoled display but believe me its very ordinary display. Its goes blind in the sunlight my Iphone 6s display is batter than this in the sun light.
Camera- back camera takes photos in details but colors are not natural. Contrast is very high. one can clearly see the difference between the actual colors and color of the objects in the photos.
Face Detection sensor- is not very good. it doesnt work all the time.
Size- Phone is large in size.
Looks- I didnt like its ugly camera bump at the back."

OnePlus 7T,4,Oneplus BEAST !!!,"I'm personally extremely happy on buying OnePlus 7T, I always used to wonder why people always talk about its features, durability, performance etc.
It surely is the Best phone within the range, I had evaluated around 4-5 Smartphones before buying this... This phone is a clear winner in all the departments ! Say it Camera, Gaming, Multitasking, Battery life, its all top notch...
The only thing I feel is, this phone could have been powered by 4000+ mAH battery which is 3800 as of now.
With OnePlus fast charging it would have been cherry on top of the üç∞
Other than that, its a BEAST"

There is been an one issue in my device and it happened within few days of my purchase. The phone was completely dead and it never responded to any hard restart too. They tried resetting the phone and had the phone on charge for sometime then it worked.  After which there hasn't been any issue."

OnePlus 7T,4,OnePlus 7t Review,Phone is fast and smooth but it get hang sometime. Not frequently you will lag.
OnePlus 7T,4,"Good, elegant",Camera has slow motion
OnePlus 7T,1,"Not the right proportion of screen size, misleading","My feedback is about the ergonomics and design of this model. The proportion of the screen size is really abrupt. They have not increased both width and height of the phone, rather only the height. This makes it an awkward proportion to use, does not enlarge the viewed content whether videos or other content and feels rather uncomfortable if the purpose is to go for a slightly bigger screen. So while it has a particular rise in screen size compared to previous models, it doesn't actually function and rather is only misguiding."

Battery life could have been improved.

OnePlus 7T,5,Good but not best,"Overall it's awesome.
Bt battery life not upto the mark.
Have to increase this.
Overall good experience"
OnePlus 7T,1,Not bad,Back side camera structure is not good
OnePlus 7T,4,iPhone -> Android,"As a user who have never used an android before, OnePlus was my first choice to consider and it did not fail to deliver.
Pros:
+Amazing OLED screen
+Super fast display (90Hz)
+Gaming mode to enhance the gaming experience
+Superb wide angle camera
+Lots of customization options for apps
+Parallel apps functionality similar to Samsung Note series
+Amazing overall performance
Cons:
From what i have used so far,
-Camera(1): Auto focus issue when its in the battery saver mode. Sometimes in the normal mode too.
-Camera(2): No detail in photos when compared to other high end models in the market. Nevertheless the photos are amazing and you cannot find anything bad when you glance at it.
-Crashing of apps (rare and common in Android)
Summary: For the money and its value wrt options and perfromance, its a great phone and a must buy."

OnePlus 7T,5,Killer,Amazing.
OnePlus 7T,5,Good,Good
OnePlus 7T,5,Good,Awesome product on this price range
OnePlus 7T,5,Well rounded budget Flagship,"The model I have with me is the OnePlus 7T 8gb ram 256gb storage option, which at Rs 39,999 (now 34,999) looked like a great option. This is the little brother of the OnePLus 7T pro, but comparing them both the extras wouldn't interest my wife much.
We have a 30 watt WARP charger included, aptly named 30T which is a variant of the charger that shipped with the oneplus 7, very nice. Oneplus phones support warp charging which can charge up your phone to 70% in 30 minutes. So if you are in a rush, 30 minutes is enough to at least give you respectable phone time. But you do need to use the included charger and cable.
A transparent case is also included, I'm liking that more and more manufacturers are including at least a silicone case with their phones. There are no ear buds of any sort, as the oneplus 7T has no headphone jack and keeping costs down being their mantra, none are included.
The screen is only 1080p , but 1080x2400 due to its 20:9 aspect ratio. OnePLus calls their display the 'Fluid AMOLED display'.  With a  90hz screen refresh rate, scrolling is soo much smoother, which only when you see it in action would you feel the fluidness of the animations. I couldn't see too much of a smoothness, but if you can't, just change to 60hz in the options which would save on battery. Color‚Äôs are generally muted or natural, but you can change between the modes if you want them to  pop. Also on the phone is a factory applied screen protector. Its ok, I do see coloration when you view the phone from an angle, but straight on, there‚Äôs no problem.
Phone unlock modes are the standard pin, pattern and face unlock etc. We also have fingerprint unlock using an in-display fingerprint sensor. Setting up is also easy, as with most fingerprint sensors, just follow the instructions and tap on the location marked to register your fingerprint. Once done, whenever we pick up the phone it displays the fingerprint sensor icon, tap it to unlock. The sensor is quite fast, unlocking almost instantaneously.  This is an optical sensor, so you can see it lighting up my finger as it scans it. Newer phones use ultrasonic fingerprint sensors, which are more accurate. But this works quite well.
The camera, the camera on the one plus 7 has been upgraded quite a bit, giving phones that cost twice as much a run for their money. There are three on the back, a 17mm ultrawide camera, a 26 millimeter wide camera as well as a 51mm telephoto camera. A 16 mp selfie camera can be found in the front, here are some sample shots. Colors are OK at this price point, but still needs some work to challenge the real flagships.
The OnePlus 7T has a 3,800 mAh battery, the battery life is respectable, but in order to squeeze a little more out of it you can switch to 60hz refresh rate for the display. But with the warp charger at hand, 30 minutes and you have the battery at 70%.
Speakers are loud in this phone, the sounds are clear and I found it to be louder than my galaxy s9 plus. The front facing speaker does most of the job, firing the sound you.
At a price point half of most flagships this phone has a great screen, great performance, and cameras are really quite good. The OS experience is fast and smooth, and the inclusion of three cameras with features like macro and steady shot are a nice touch. The speakers are also loud, and a hdr 10 compliant display would make content consumption more gratifying. Getting such a well rounded phone for the price is amazing, hats off to oneplus for pulling this off."
OnePlus 7T,5,One plus is Poor man‚Äôs iPhone,Overall a good product. Camera is superb and screen refresh rate is the USP I think. Good response.
OnePlus 7T,5,good performance this mobile,good performance this mobile
OnePlus 7T,2,Not suitable for people who uses apps much,"The worst phone in one plus is one plus 7t, reason most of apps are not supporting"
OnePlus 7T,5,Product is good,Speed and operational features
OnePlus 7T,5,Good Phone,"It's a good phone but honestly I loved my 5t more üòä
There was a lot of heating issues initially but after an update looks like it's fixed.
Overall one plus never disappoints üëçüëç"
OnePlus 7T,5,Best smartphone in this price segment.,"After using it for a month I must say it has that speedy response, superb camera, fingerprint reader is WoW. Battery life doesn't last long due to 90hz refresh rate but yes it would give you 15-18 hrs of usage after full charge. Better than costly Apple and Samsung."
OnePlus 7T,4,Poor battery,battery drains too fast
OnePlus 7T,5,High performance,Very very good and beautiful high performance never ever before and best smart phone in 2019 and 2020
OnePlus 7T,5,Phone is good,Awesome mobile
OnePlus 7T,5,Awesome,Lovely
OnePlus 7T,5,Mobile with best Hardware and Software,"Amazing power packed mobile phone with well thought upon software and hardware features, OnePlus provides most of the features which I have always wanted in my mobile most of which are not known to many so I tried covering them in best possible ways.
PROS
-------
1) Oneplus mobiles are always optimized with best available hardware at the time of launch leaving no room for any competition and demand, moreover the Oxygen OS software is updated regularly fixing any issues and suggestions provided by the user community.
2) Contains almost all the needed software without any unnecessary bloatware like MI, Samsung and other mobile providers thus preventing any need for installing or purchasing from the google store
i) Contains inbuilt call recorder integrated inside the phone dialer
ii) Contains inbuilt screen recorder which records best quality videos
iii) Inbuit features like Night Mode, Reading Mode, Zen Mode, Focus Mode to suit the different usage of mobile
during a specific scenario
iv) An exclusive features when the mobile flash is used as a torch the brightness is reduced and when using it for
photos or videos the full flash brightness is used, this was something I wanted in phone as it serves the
intended purpose of flash light without putting stress on eyes and battery
v) Built in caller identification which does not work as well as Truecaller so can be ignored or disabled
3) Pre-configured themes to suit different people and since having an AMOLED display the dark theme just provides the best experience to users.
4) Excellent memory management for all apps which is optimized for most used apps to provided the best experience to users without unnecessarily killing the apps
5) Built in steps counter and digital wellbeing feature which tracks overall phone usage and provides a holistic report to user regarding how much time is spent on different applications
6) Comes with 90 Hz display which I feel is over marketed, I haven't seen much differences on using the 90 Hz over 60 Ghz just that the battery drains faster.
All the above provides the OnePlus launcher an edge over the default Android experience, the Oxygen OS is lightweight and feature packed and actively improved by the company, there are certain issues which the companies might fix in the future updates.
CONS
-------
1) The Oxygen OS is buggy and sometimes the mobile screen just blanks out leaving the user with no other option to go for a force reboot, I have faced it couple of time where the screen goes unresponsive but mobile calls can be heard.
2) The camera application should be further optimized as the mobile contains best available camera hardware but fails to capture good photos in various overly bright and dark environments.
3) Mobile screen is too large to use with one hand and there is no feature to reduce the screen size which even basic mobiles from Moto and other manufactures provides
4) The WiFi calling is good but several times the voice just stops in after few seconds but the dialer app still shows the called as connected, this is happening just for the WiFi calling option but not on the network calling
5) Battery works great and provides backup for around two days but sometimes it drains faster than expected still providing one day backup, this could be optimized in future updates."
OnePlus 7T,5,Best phone(after doing cost benefit analysis)as of date,Am writting this review after 3 months of heavy usage. I am glad i sold my samsung note 9 and got this. Exceptional performance on all parameters. A complete package. Only thing that i would recommend you to bus is a C port to 3.5mm converter. Try the one from wayona or one plus has one on their official website.
OnePlus 7T,5,Good Phone to use,Good
OnePlus 7T,4,Good at best not great,Camera is poor for the price....
OnePlus 7T,4,7T wonderful one,Refresh rate and fast fingerprint are good
OnePlus 7T,5,7t > Rog 2  In real life uses.,Phone is excellent. If you are coming from a smaller Phone like me Moto g5 plus you will appreciate this. I was going for Asus Rog 2 but it doesn't have a stable platform like 1+ and neither the update. As far as goes for gaming it can play all the game easily. I am a Gamer but Rog 2 was was just too much for me. 1+ and Rog 2 were my favourite Phone this year.

Camera is also average, same qaulity we can get in any phone around 20k.
90 hrtz refresh doesn't make that much difference, 120 hertz would have helped.

It is not as expected from one plus in premium category phone üì±. Think before investing huge amount to buy this not so good piece from 1+.
OnePlus 7T,5,One Plus 7T,Good
OnePlus 7T,5,Really Nice,"Quality awesome
One plus 7T fabulous looking"
OnePlus 7T,5,Feather touch,Using of this feels feather touch
OnePlus 7T,3,Phone fits for the average user but not heavy user,The battery life is too worst if you are a heavy user due to the 90hz display and 3800mah only and if you want to get more battery life satisfy the 90hz display and shift to 60hz display  in settings and the front camera also too worst and the back camera is blur in normal mode at some areas near to the edges remaining all good of my 10 days usage.
OnePlus 7T,3,battery issue,i find battery is worst.. and it says it charges 0-70% in 30 mins which is absolutely wrong . i have calculated many a number of times about the charge but it never charged 70% in 30mins. and moreover the battery life is not long lasting and the charge continues to decrease even when i am not in touch with the phone. i wonder what would happen to this phone's battery a year or two later..
OnePlus 7T,5,Awesome mobile,Amazing phone

OnePlus 7T,5,One of best phone.,Best phone.90hz is amazing üî•
OnePlus 7T,5,A great buy at this price point.,"Pros:
1. 90hz display giving a really smooth experience.
2. Snapdragon  855+ processor giving great performance.
3. Warp charge 30T helps charge the phone amazingly fast.
4. Build quality is really great. The phone looks gorgeous and premium to hold.
5. Stereo speakers in the phone gives immersive experience while watching videos and playing games. It is loud and clear.
6. Haptic vibration makes gameplay better. I really liked it.
7. Oxygen Os gives best user experience. Period.
Cons:
1. Camera quality is descent not great. It click some amazing shots but not exceptional as expected.
2. Battery life is not that good maybe because of 90hz display. Normal usage can provide you full day battery life but if you play games then battery will take a great hit.
Overall, a great buy at this price point."

OnePlus 7T,4,Value for money,Good phone
OnePlus 7T,5,Oxygen OS worth it!!!,Buy it for the oxygen OS. Problem of any android device is that after a few months of usage phone starts to lag and oxygen os is the best option out there which gives you smooth performance and customization. The camera quality is not that great but then OnePlus was never know for producing good cameras. From the very beginning they have been weak on the camera department. Hopefully in future they do really catch up competitors. In terms of camera features and rest of the things they have equal to competition and sometimes even better than what others but camera video or photo quality not up to the competitors levels. Battery life is good. Display is also good. This is an easy pick up as you won't anything else compelling at this price point.
OnePlus 7T,5,Ultimate phone of the year 2020.,I bought the phone during the republic day sale and it cost me e around Rs 33500. The phone is undoubtedly exceptional and totally meets the expectations it is much better than the Apple iPhone I must say. the oneplus has done a good job in making the phone awesome it's 8GB RAM and ultimate camera you can take vivid pictures during any night time and day time the Amazon service was pretty quick and they delivered within 12 hours thanks to Amazon.

However i waited and wanted to check for atleast a day of usage. Heating issue is again happening on the second day especially near the top speaker area which I can feel while talking. Not sure whether some update is require or it's actually a problem. I suspect while playing heavy games it may go more high. So as of now I can say this phone has some heating issue. Attached the screenshots for thermal readings which I took from an app named CPUZ

OnePlus 7T,5,The best phone ever,Super top
OnePlus 7T,5,Worth it,Vry good

OnePlus 7T,4,Battery Drains quickly ?,"I have bought this phone on great Indian sale and writing this review after 4 days of usage only - too early to write a review ryt ?. May b.. may not be.
Let's just jump in to ""battery life"" of this device.
I have seen comments on battery life like it drains quickly.. and worst.. etc etc and still I have given 4 star out of 5 . Why ? . You have to understand that you are using 90 hz display not 60 hz. This ll consume more energy than 60. You can change the refreshing rate in display settings if you want a better battery life .
Then what about rest of the performance/Build quality/cam etc ?. Just one word.. ""awesome""."
OnePlus 7T,5,Phone is great with it's all aliment.,The fingerprint reader and it's camera quality is absolutely amazing and the battery life is also good and it's vooc charger charges the phone in few minutes. Sound quality amazing with stereo speakers I'm amazed to listen. Ovar all phone is awesome.

OnePlus 7T,5,"PUBG solution, The best phone","very smooth the best i have used in my life till now, if you want to play PUBG, then you'll be slightly disappointed as you have to use bluetooth earphones but there's delay in bluetooth in sound and video only for the games, as OnePlus has software for syncing audio in videos
so the solution is to use wired earphones, using the OnePlus converter from usb c to 3.5mm Jack."

OnePlus 7T,4,Battery life.,Battery life of my new phone is very less..it's battery backup is even lesser than the phone that I was using since last 2.5 years..quite unhappy..
OnePlus 7T,5,Feedback,"Sometime it takes you 2-3 times for finger point senser to respond.
Batter life - it takes longer time to charge and faster time to discharge , it needs to other way around."
OnePlus 7T,5,One plus nailed it again,The best of both worlds. Software experience and premium camera features. Fabulous buy for a camera lovers. Clutter free UI.

OnePlus 7T,2,OnePlus 7t,Not up to the mark
OnePlus 7T,5,One plus 7t,It is one of the best smart phone out there
OnePlus 7T,5,OnePlus 4 you,"Fingerprint reader is very good feature it's takes milliseconds to unlock your phone.
The battery life is good enough can last for more than a day upon usage.

OnePlus 7T,5,Awesome,Very good
OnePlus 7T,5,Won't regret buying it.Its awsum,"Earlier have I used redmi Samsung but now after using this I can guarantee this that this phone is a class apart.the finger print sensor battery life, touch, display is such so amazing.though I feel the camera should have been better.but at this price range this is an awsum package. Much better than Samsung and I phone in this range or above this range."
OnePlus 7T,4,Worth the spend,"It's a no nonsense phone from OnePlus, value for the money paid."
OnePlus 7T,5,Best Mobile Phone of the current times,"A wonderful Phone which excels in every aspect be it hardware, software, connectivity, looks & others.
Battery is the only department where I am not extremely happy with this phone as it only lasts from a full charge to 10% from morning till evening. If I use it slightly more, I would need to charge it once during the office hours as well so as to have sufficient charge while travelling back to home. But all this is balanced by the Fast Warp Charging Feature pretty well."
OnePlus 7T,4,Good,Very nice for me to use.
OnePlus 7T,3,Cry after you buy that i wasted 38k of mine!,"The parent company of one plus is oppo.
Now oppo vivo are the companies i personally don't recommend to buy. i take them as mobile camera improvement companies.
One plus might be good, but for only 3900 mah battery and 90 hz screen, you are paying this much amount of money. nothing special about this phone. And you are going to use normal 60 hz screen for most of the time to save your battery! so 90 hz is nothing but a gametime improvement. And if you are working/job/business or related, you won't have proper time to play.
So save your hard earned money. Even if you are thinking that let's buy it on EMI its a trap to sell overpriced simple little better phone to you.
Which does nothing more then a simple normal smartphone.
You say better processor? i play COD on my redmi note 5 pro by rooting it. with custom rom and better battery and ram management, i get 60 fps in game!
If you are too much attracted to this phone, consider again that other three phones this companies are making, have failed. vivo, oppo and realme. where, realme is a copy product of  redmi- a chinese phone.
You will ask me that quit your blabbering, tell me how it works?
Any phone works on processor and rom.
Now, if you know little bit about how to change roms, you can install Oxygen OS on any phone and it will work like one plus 7t!
By installing softwares like google camera, any camera will perform better!
Yes the phone works fast and better then your old mobile. but that doesn't make your day any less harder. I travel in mumbai locals and i constantly worry about my phone to be stolen and sold to pieces.
finger print reader is fast. but it doesn't matter as i said! if it works at 1.3 milli seconds or 1 second it won't bother you.
Don't be a lamb to join the flagship level. You are actually not getting anything out of your phone! you are just wasting the money you earned on a toy. which You could spend it better on health, food or gym!
Sayonara!
we are still Indians. we are poor. let the wealthy countries buy the costly and useless devices and showoff. we do juggaad!
i am the one who wasted my money on this one and then got the sense. That's why i am writing this revies so it can help some of you!
Buh-bye."
OnePlus 7T,4,Value for money (well mostly),Performance is unparalleled. Camera performance is a hit or miss. Feels good in hand. Speakers are good. Tpu case gets yellowish pretty quickly. Applied plastic screen guard takes in hairline scratches as soon as u start using it. Charging is really quick. Has some bloat that you can't uninstall. Silver back is not that dark.
OnePlus 7T,3,Need to upgrade batter life.,Battery life not good..
OnePlus 7T,5,Great performer,Performance is very very good...
OnePlus 7T,5,I am loving it,Best phone ever
OnePlus 7T,5,Good phone to buy,Good
OnePlus 7T,5,Great product,"Excellent camera quality, fingerprint sensor is very speed, battery life is good 8hours non-stop"
OnePlus 7T,4,Highest average score phone,"Great phone, has a classic a sleek look, the processor is strong enough for you to play pubg in the highest display settings (graphics and fps). No shitty bloatware apps like other OS(Oneplus 7t has Oxygen OS), this makes the phone more professional.This phone is an all-rounder in all activities may that be camera ,gaming ,video streaming etc. The only problem I have faced is that the battery backup is a little low, I don't know this problem is seen in my product specifically or all 7t in general, still the 30t charger chages it in no time."

OnePlus 7T,5,Read my review,I liked this mobile. First time using OnePlus. This model 7T is nice. The only thing is incoming voice and outgoing voice during the call is low than Samsung.
OnePlus 7T,5,Best phone,Awesome phone üëç
OnePlus 7T,4,very premium looking product. can make improvements,"Fingerprint scanner opens well but sometimes looks confused in terms of transition effect to open the home screen, it gives a glimpse of the pin  screen (open with pin) and then vanishes and lands on the home screen. the photo quality can definitely improve in terms of the depth sensors (doesnt look like the grey sensors dont measure the depth properly)
Otherwise, a Great looking product with good UI (and am liking the gesture controls on the Latest Android version).
I have heard a lot of complaints on the battery performance. Its only 2 days and it lasted me more than 24 hrs on a single charge."
OnePlus 7T,4,Excellent performance,good
OnePlus 7T,5,"Name is Oneplus, so go for it!!",There‚Äôs no need of writing a review. It‚Äôs well known that Oneplus gives us great phones every year. And this time too they gave us a perfect phone at a decent price. Gives almost all features of Oneplus 7T pro. So if you have fund issues to buy pro then don‚Äôt hesitate to buy 7T. Only problem that caused me is the camera shape. I personally feel that the circular shape looks a bit too bulky for the phone ( still not a very big issue). But without that I give a 11/10 for this.
OnePlus 7T,5,True all-rounder,"If you are looking for a phone that has great display, fast charging, great camera and smooth performance, OnePlus 7t is the phone to go after.
OnePlus has been always offering great at display, fast charging, and great smooth performance. With the launch of OnePlus 7t, they have really improved the camera quality. The triple camera setup certainly helps to capture great photos. Truly impressed with the portraits, ultra wide mode, and nightscape modes.
If you ignore the back camera bump with circular setup, this is fantastic phone. Strongly recommend it."
OnePlus 7T,4,Awesome except that camera Bump,Awesome device with awesome features. 1 star less just for camera bump due to that it is very difficult to find good case that supports Oneplus official 3D glass protector. I spent 1300 on OnePlus official tempered glass now there is no budget friendly covers that supports it.

I already replaced my first OnePlus 7t device becuause of the same issue and bought a new one and after approx 2 month same issue is emerging in this device also... I already made complaints regarding this issue and they provide some technical solutions but still it's useless. Now they are saying we will pic your phone and upgrade your device software, it means if i give them my phone then i have to wait for some days to get my phone back till i have to live without phone...
Just a worst device i ever used, if u are thinking to buy it please go for some other oneplus device or on other brand"

For those who are complaining about battery trust me battery is not bad. try below stesps.
1) goto Display setting>screen Calibration> select advance and under it select Amoled Wide Gamut. and keep the colors tempreture cooler.
2) Try using black wallpaer for lock screen and use pre-installed wallpaper for home screen.
if still facing issue reduce your screen to 60HZ display.
Headphone type c connector is missing in the box and that is something not acceptable you have to spend more 430 rs to buy it.

They could hv included a proper cover for such a price. Oh and not to mention the packaging. Whosoever packed it, packed it thinking it's a brick and not a phone and I could see the delivery person tossing the packages so one can imagine the condition of phone which isn't properly packed.

OnePlus 7T,4,Flagship's Honest Reviews,"They should have given a higher pixel density screen with curved display like pro version to make it be 'Value for Money'.
Difference of RAM and a higher memory with pop up selfie would have been 'the extra' for pro users.
There is no earphone with c-type connector (ofcourse of good quality) which makes it less value for money.
And yes this too hangs at times, so I do not totally agree with 'the speed' factor of One Plus.
Honestly, I didn't find even iPhone X woth or Latest galaxy worth the price tags.
I feel Samsung's Note series is ok, but even that too should be priced  a little lower."

Otherwise the handset is awesome but comparitively heavier than my old Samsung Galaxy S7 edge. I have been using premium mobile phones for a long time, it feels less premium (that's personal opinion). Build quality is solid. Amazon's delivery is lightning fast.

OnePlus 7T,5,The best device In one word I'll just describe Awesome,The best device with perfect OS/UI and powerful processor and a Great display with smooth 90hz refresh rate. In one word I'll just describe Awesome
OnePlus 7T,5,GREAT DEVICE AND VERY ROBUST,LOVELY PHONE AND VFM
OnePlus 7T,5,A VFM product that goes beyond,"I have received the package with all the security and pin number and parcel code as though it was delivered by the IB. Then realized that people have been sent soap and marbles in such packaging in the past that Amazon had to secure it from the middlemen who sneak it through.
The 7T is a powerhouse and yet it saves a lot of power to push you through the day. All in all, the phone is excellent with a lot of tinkering options available for you to play with this handful of tech marble(not marvel). But the irony is not lost on the fact that I have clicked the attached pics with one of the better camera phones (Honor 8 pro) for the review. Will update with the pics clicked by 7T soon. Thanks to Amazon for the timely delivery and Thanks OP for maintaining the quality and challenging the status quo.
Never Settle OP."

OnePlus 7T,1,Not able to Unlock the Phone,"Got the Phone delivered today morning.
Completed basic Config for the Phone and it worked well for a while and now I am not able to unlock my Phone.
This is really upsetting after purchasing a Flagship Smartphone.
Going to return the device."
OnePlus 7T,5,Smooth software and best mobile,One of the best mobile of the year and smooth handling hardware
OnePlus 7T,5,üòé,Woww product ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
OnePlus 7T,5,Top notch phone,"The good: lightning-fast phone. Oxegen OS is brilliant, everything you need and no bloatware. The screen is big, very clear, and ultra-smooth due to the fast refresh rate. Not rated as waterproof but it can take a dunk and keep going. Looks amazing, very good build quality. Warp charge is the best fast charging tech out there. 0% to 80% takes about 15minutes.
The bad: no wireless charging. Pictures are a bit too crisp making things look a bit surreal. The in-screen fingerprint scanner is not as fast or as accurate as of the dedicated scanners from the last generation. But once that happens, the phone is very good and fast. Even wearing a hoodie with sunglasses it will pick me up.
Overall I would recommend this phone for people who watch a lot of videos, play a lot of games, or run multiple apps often. Not for people who take a lot of selfies or care about having the absolute best camera on the market."

I bought a One Plus 7T handset on date 29th dec.  I have recently start experiencing some issues with my phone. The phone got switched off while it was still completely charged. I had to take it to the service center. Though they were able to start it, I am still experiencing some issues like the phone hanging while use and unclarity and echos while on calls. Are these known issues with 1+7T handsets or probably I could have gotten a defective piece? Please can you help with getting these issues fixed or getting the handset replaced? I would be very grateful if you could help me with this?

It is powered by the Snapdragon 855+ SoC processor, ideal for fast lag free Performance.
only request is to make phones atleast resistant to water and dust , if not waterproof."

Also for playing pubg and while charging.
And pubg game  is lagging in HDR mode and we can't play in ultra HD mode"
OnePlus 7T,5,Killer Phone,"Switching from iPhone XR, the device is blazing fast. IRIS Scanner is simply superb and it kills face ID. Warp charge is amazingly fast and it charges your device so quickly. eg: put the device on charge when you get ready to work. It keeps you all day long. Performance is insane.
OnePlus still have to work on camera as it's just an average. Otherwise this device beats all other phone hands down.
Still I would say, go for it and you won't regret at all.. üëç

Pros-
-camera quality is superb

-with battery saver turned on battery comes for 2 days with basic usage (calls, WhatsApp, browsing)
-speaker audio quality is good
Cons-
-i couldn't realize how the 90 hz refresh rate improves speed and performance. I couldn't find any difference from an MI phone's.
-only USB c port for earphone. So have to buy a Bluetooth earphone or the unreliable c port connectors.
-double tap to wake up the screen is not working for me
-not for people who handles their phones carelessly/rough handles"

OnePlus 7T,5,Best phone at 34-39k than spending 70-100k on iPhone and get nothing but disappointment!!,"Battery life is not that good if you're using the phone or playing game for a longtime in single charge.
I charge the phone and use it hardly for 3-4 hours in whole day keeping Mobile Data On throughout still it manages to stay at 10-15% by 24th Hour.
But Warp Charger won't let you down ‚úåüèª
Best at audio output both wired and wireless!
Video enhancement is implemented very well.
Do buy it when it's available for ‚Çπ34999 with UAG case to protect your phone. I have no idea and trust on other cases to protect Oneplus 7T as the back panel is made of glass (you can refer to durability tests on YouTube, to get an Idea about what I'm trying to say about the protection).

OnePlus 7T,5,Best feature packed phone in this price tag,"Oneplus is known for its high end flagship specifications, user-friendly features and competitive price. There is no doubt that Oneplus has proved it again with 7T.
The Oxygen OS looks extra snappy with the Andriod 10 flavor. Fingerprint reader is pretty fast as well. Battery is better and can still be optimized. Thanks to the warp charge 30T tech for its unprecedented charging time.
Undoubtedly camera department needs improvement as Oneplus is no more a flagship killer rather a flagship itself :)."

OnePlus 7T,5,Great Phone,Finger print reader is great in ever OnePlus phone the camera is also great. Battery is good but you you can always charge it from 0 to 100% under 1 hour. It is smooth as a butter. Android 10 out of the box
OnePlus 7T,5,Nice one,I am loving this product.
OnePlus 7T,3,Phone suddenly became dead,"I got this phone on the 2nd of Jan-2020. However, I started using it only since 12th Jan-2020 since I was travelling to another country. On the 2nd day of usage itself, the phone all of a sudden became dead( just a while it had around 30% battery, so it wasnt a off due to battery). Tried to re-start, even connected the charger for around 40 minutes, however there was no activity on the phone( no LEDs and the phone wasn't booting up, even no messages). After many tries, I kept the phone as it is. I did some research and found many users complaining about similar issues( seems some issue with the phone motherboard). On the next day, tried to power on and then it gave a message that the phone was too low on battery. After charging , it then booted up. So, am gravely worried if this issue comes up again(looks like some internal phone issue) on such a premium phone. I am keeping my fingers crossed for now.  I was hoping for a better experience from a OnePlus phone, but my initial experience isnt GOOD. Since I am out of town, I didnt explore the option to returning the phone back. Hoping to hear from Oneplus about this issue and my future course of action if such an issue occurs again."
OnePlus 7T,5,Overall a good purchase,Camera quality is great ... However in night mode it artificially illuminate the object which fails to capture the true dark background... But then its not a slr camera... Fingerprint sensor  is moderately fast .... rest ures experience is very good.. the case given in package is very cheap and ugly... I think they should provide better one..

OnePlus 7T,2,Super,Nice
OnePlus 7T,2,Great phone ruined by bad display panel!,"It's pretty decent phone which OnePlus ruined by bad display. Works really smoothly and kind of the best smartphone for performance-centric users.
However, there are a few things I would like to let people know.
Disadvantages:
- Display panel is made by Samsung but surely of poor quality. You will find green tint in gray area and even ghosting problem in black and gray moving areas. Really ruins video viewing experience.
I recommend you to go for OnePlus 7 Pro instead because even though that is having green tint issue as well, the tint is uniform in the display.
- Touch response is average. Ah, it is more or less like my Galaxy J7 (2016). Totally destroys gaming experience with games like PUBGM. Phones like Redmi K20 Pro, realme X2 Pro, ASUS ROG Phone 2 etc. are way ahead even though two of them are cheaper.
You'll have hard time in close encounters while gaming if you came from a device which had excellent or good touch response.
- Audio and Vibration motor (Haptic Feedback) are not even on per X2 Pro which is cheaper than this device.
- There is ghost touch issue at times while playing PUBGM. I have tried two units, first one was the original purchased device and second one was replacement unit.
- Battery life is average. The standby battery drains totally makes the battery life poor. However, if you continuously use it, you will end up with good duration of use. (not everyone do that though)
Advantages:
- Well, it is smoothest Android phone. ROG 2 might have 120hz refresh rate panel but the UI stutters a lot, while OnePlus 7T is really smooth all the time.
- PUBGM works great if you compare it with other Android devices. However, the typical render lag and the lags when there are multiple squads fighting are there. If PUBG Mobile is your priority, go for iPad or iPhone 8 Plus (or above).
- Doesn't heat a lot. Well, compared to other devices like X2 Pro and ROG 2, I found it really better at managing its thermals. Also, its thermal throttling triggers after really high temperature which results in smooth gaming for longer period than 'any other phone'.
- Software updates are good. It is not too much buggy like some other devices. However, you won't find Oxygen OS as good as before. OnePlus India is continuously adding bloatwares. However, for the time being, it is a plus point for this device."

OnePlus 7T,2,overpriced product,System files take up 27 GB. There is some problem with software of OP 7 T
OnePlus 7T,4,Feed back about One plus 7t,"For more than 5 to 6 years. I was using iphone and was happy. But i had purchased this phone after people view about the phone.
While attaching a pic to watsapp. It got hanged and i have hard boot the device. And after hardboot it working fine. Now but not happy by this type of hang stuffs."

OnePlus 7T,5,Very Good üëç,Good
OnePlus 7T,1,Please dont go with hype,"Believe me dont go with the hype, if you are really concerned about performance with security this phone is surely not meant for you. This is for young generation only who just want to click pictures, not for professionals. Face Recognition is worse, most apps dont work the way they should, most apps crashes, there is nothing like encryption. Please take this into notice before purchase else you will regret.  This phone is not an alternate to iPhones and Samsung Flagships, it is not even near to that."

OnePlus 7T,5,Go for it. Not a second thought.,"Awesome phone. Don't listen to the paid YouTube reviews. Battery backup lasts for a day with medium use....not an issue as charging is really fast. Camera is very descent. You shouldn't compare it with Samsung S9 or S10 or iPhone mobiles....but is nice. Low light clicks are better than many mobile phones. Check my samples.
Rest all....like body, processor, sound quality, screen quality etc...full 10 on 10"

Battery is also good i am getting around 6 to 7 hrs screen on time
Build quality is excellent
You will get very good back cover
Cons
Display is little warmer but u will not notice much
Selfie camera is little disappointing

I hardly have any issues with it. The only thing is the 90Hz display- It's beautifully smooth but drains ALOT of battery. You can use it only if you have a charger near you all the time.

OnePlus 7T,5,Best Smartphone - Software does matter than just the Hardware,I am very happy with the performance of the One plus 7t.

The performance wise i doesnt feel much difference despite of having upgraded OS. Camera is way much better due to change in lens. The most disappointed thing in this phone is battery. I have to charge it minimum two times for a use of least 14 to 15 hours. Atleast they have to upgrade the software to be feasible with 3800 Mah battery. Looks are good having a circular lens on the side."

OnePlus 7T,5,The WoW Phone.,Bought it from one plus store with attractive gifts one month back for 6th anniversary sale. I feel store has more offers. One can blindly go for it unless and until you dont have a strong preference for battery. Dual Speakers are just wow. I rate 10/10 for all the features of One Plus 7T  but for battery it's 6/10 for this price range.

OnePlus 7T,5,OnePlus 7T,Better product from Oneplus.I liked the phone after using it. Certain things are phone battery will drain after continuous usage.Good thing is they have given warp charge which recharge battery very quickly. Sometimes it gets heated if we browse for longtime this things the phone has to overcome maybe in future.

OnePlus 7T,5,Awesome,great quality phone
OnePlus 7T,4,Case quality and battery performance not good,Battery quality should not good. It will work hardly 12 hr on Fully charrged. Case quality should be good atleast orginal case by 1 plus product.
OnePlus 7T,5,Awesome,Awesome
OnePlus 7T,4,"Only issue may be the battery life, other than that go for it!!!","I'm more of a laptop person, but wanted a good phone and i think i got it. This review is after usage of 15 days.
So, this one's going to be in different points:
1.) Display: 90 Hz is really good if you spend a lot of your time in your phone. If you keep on 90 Hz you will get even less than average battery life. I recommend turning on 90 Hz only when you are doing something which needs great display quality.
2.) Battery: It's the only con i could find in this great phone. BUT,BUT,BUT, the charger makes up around 90% of this less battery life issue. You can get full charge from 0 in at max 70 minutes. To summarize, you can go for it if you have a desk job.
3.) Performance: It's pretty fast. As fast as any reasonable person would need. Truth is this is a 35k phone, so the performance you get is definitely worth 50k. Don't compare it with phones which are above 80k or 90k. If you do that, you're just a badgering person.
4.) Camera: Not really a camera freak, but it's really good. You get all the details you want and expect from a cell phone. IF YOU ARE A SELF-CERTIFIED CAMERA ENTHUSIAST, BUY A DSLR. Nobody's stopping you from that. Don't hope a phone will give you the world's best camera.
I wish i could give 4.5 stars but since Amazon only supports a Floor Function or a Ceiling Function when it comes to rating, could only give a 4."
OnePlus 7T,5,Smooth and clean Android experience,"90Hz refresh rate, macro camera, warp charging and beautiful display make this phone one of the best Android phones out there"
OnePlus 7T,5,Amazing experience!!,"Build quality is top notch..Feels premium in hand. Camera unit is pretty amazing in that prize range epically nightscape works like magic!. Snapdragon 855+ processor is crazy fast, pairing this with adreno 640 GPU and 8 gigs of ram any game available for android runs flawlessly and fluidly . For dynamic sund lovers the stereo speakers work really fine. Haptic motor is improved and you feel that while using the phone. Fingerprint reader situated under the screen is the fastest fingerprint reader in under screen fingerprint readers on different phones but comparing this with physical fingerprint sensors is not fair.And finally coming to its 90hz panel..its so good that once you get used to the fluidity of this panel you won't see anything on phone having frame rate below 90hz, the experience is magical. As a bonus you get warp charger 30T which is 18% faster than one plus 7 pro, its really handy to juice up your phone rapidly. To sum this up...A phone with 90hz panel, fastest processor by snapdragon, stereo speakers, quality camera setup, warp charger..This is the best option at this price point..Kudos!"

OnePlus 7T,4,"Beast performance, average-decent battery","The phone is excellent for everyday use and performance wise.
Highlights:-
1. The camera performance is mind blowing, you will be amazed with the camera shots and night mode. The pictures barely need any after edits if you want to directly post on Instagram.
2. Charging is super fast. No complains, phone is ready for use in half n hour.
3. Overall performance, RAM management, storage speeds, oxygen OS, 90hz display is as usual very good. Refresh rate is definitely noticeable to me but it depends on person to person.
Some negatives:-
1. The slightly disappointing thing is the battery performance which is just average. It has improved quite a lot after recent updates but not extraordinary.
2. The display is awesome but it might appear too bright sometimes, need some sort of feature to lower the glare sometimes.
3. Fingerprint reader is fast but not the best finger detection.
4. A major problem for one who has small hands is that the phone is very tall. It is very hard to type, I have had the toughest experience to type on this phone."

OnePlus 7T,4,A wise decision,"Was planning to buy Samsung M30 for my wife. But after reading about lot of issues with the model, went for OnePlus 7T. Double the price, but I'm happy I chose this. No it is not fair to compare the two models but the pathetic quality of M30 with network signal and connectivity issues, it definitely is not worth 14k+
Coming back to 7T, there's hardly anything negative noticed after a week of usage. Camera is top notch, low light shots are excellent, battery lasts more than a day even with maximum use of mobile data and WiFi.
Will update this review after a month."

Now I knida like it. The camera is decent. The phone is way fast of course with the snapdragon 855 plus. Finger print unlock, best in the class and face unlock is blazing fast. Fastest among all i have used. But I do feel the battery capacity much have been a little bigger, it's only 3800, but again you get the warp charger. So it cover up this con. And love the colour even. An the Fluid amoled display with the 90hz refresh rate, brightness is good for outdoors even, goes up to 1000 nits. It's sick overall. So, Never Settle, it is."

OnePlus 7T,5,Great phone for a great price.,"This is the fastest phone I've ever laid my hands on. I never thought speed would make such a difference. Mid range phones are very good these days making flagship phones less attractive. But this phone is just so fast, it makes all that extra money you put in worthwhile. This phone will be good for 3 years easily just because of the specs and power. You can directly upgrade from this phone to a good foldable in 3 years. Stock camera disappoints sometimes in certain scenarios but gcam comes to the rescue. You cannot blindly open the stock cam in an urgent situation. Keep both and use whichever you think will suit the situation. That's the only minor problem with this phone. Also the fingerprint reader isn't perfect. I suggest registering each of your fingers twice to improve results. Otherwise everything is perfect. Screen ,battery life, performance, speakers, charging speed, UI, in hand feel and touch response. It's all 5 out of 5! The price is the cherry on the cake. I don't know why people are still buying Note 10s and Pixels. This phone has everything at half the price. I have a pixel too and honestly I liked the software of the Oneplus better! It's that clean. 128 gb is more than enough for most people.
For 33K this phone is a steal. If this is your first time with OnePlus and doubting the brand. Just don't. The phone comes with 2 year warranty and free pick up and drop for any service issues. That's the kind of focus the brand is putting in here. So don't worry about the reliability."
OnePlus 7T,4,Make good,Battery backup is not good.
OnePlus 7T,2,OnePlus 7t sucks.,"Camera performance at Low light and nightscape isn't good enough for a mobile at this price range. The battery is just average, it depends on your usage. I got 6.5hr of sot even at 90hz refreshrate, i have attached the screenshots of the app i used.
EDITED : after 10 days of usage i found an issue with the battery. It drains 9-10% overnight when the mobile is idle. I'm trying to replace this device, will let you guys know in few days. OnePlus 7t really sucks."

No resale value. I purchased in 43000 before one year and now resale value is 15000 . Wtf.
Camera quality is good outside the door not inside.
Not more features in camera sitting . Camera sitting look like a 5000 Android phone .
Side button for ""Ring vibrate and silent"" is not working. Update notification is on Time but latest version not good.
Finally I says, never use OnePlus product.
If OnePlus sale it below 15000. You should purchase."

OnePlus 6T,5,The all time best choice of my phone's till date,"Let me divide the review into phases,one before Android 10 update & the other with 10.
Before 10:
Pros:
1) Smooth experience with Oxygen OS
2) No lag at all
3) Fast Charge is a good thing
4) Regular updates from OnePlus :-)
Cons:
1) Since it was the first model from OnePlus to have in display fingerprint I used to find difficulty most of the times in unlocking the phone quickly when compared to other models like OnePlus 7 & other 7 series as well.
2) Battery capacity could have been increased
Post 10 update:
Pros:
1) With new update finally the in display fingerprint improved greatly and now I am able to unlock it in just one tap :-)
2)Even added lot of other options as well with this update.
3) Dark mode is just awesome :-)
4) Overall smoothness never compromised
Cons:
1) Nothing to say much but I feel like battery capacity should be provided a bit higher as mentioned earlier.
2) That's all for now Will update later if I find any :-)
Note:
Just get to join the ""Red Cable Club"" by OnePlus where you can avail benefits like
1) 50% off on battery replacement (for models till OnePlus 6)
2) 1 year additional warranty (for models from OnePlus 6T & Higher)
3)Also you could other benefits like free limited (t&c apply) cloud storage...
Happy to be part of OnePlus Family :-):-)"

OnePlus 6T,3,Over hyped phone,"I was wondering why everyone is crazy about OnePlus phones. After using the phone for about 6 months I started realizing that this craziness is because of the hype they created in their entry period.
Frankly speaking this phone doesn't deserve this much hype.
Pros: performance, screen, face unlock
Cons: if you ever tried panaroma in OnePlus phones you will definitely hate it.
It's the worst when you use it with flash in light. It produces red-eye in all photos.
Fingerprint sensor takes long to unlock.
I tried to raise this issue in their support but didn't help they are asking me to do lot of reset and if it failed they are asking me to go the their service center.
Finally,  not worth the hype."

OnePlus 6T,5,Shoots impressive photos,"I'm reviewing after 4 months of usage and so far there is no issue and has been running smooth. Sound quality is great. Battery life can be better but the dash charger charges it pretty fast so it kinda compensates. Clicks awesome photos. Both daylight and Dim light photos are pretty impressive. Fingerprint sensor can be a lil tricky. It doesn't read greasy or sweaty fingers üòÑ. Overall, I'd give a thumbs up!"

OnePlus 6T,5,Power-packed phone!,Great product!
OnePlus 6T,4,Better quality,Well & good in comparison to value
OnePlus 6T,4,Flagship killer,"An Ideal flagship killer.
This is a powerful phone with a good looking body design. I am an old one plus user and I am happy with what they have done with this phone. The improvements from previous phones are clearly outstanding.
Talking about the phone in detail.
1. DESIGN : -
The design of the phone is okay. It looks good with midnight black finish. The teardrop notch looks good and the full screen display is perfect. The major downsides in design are :-
Camera bump
Lack of earphones/headphone jack
The phone is a bit heavy.
2. Memory and PROCESSOR : -
It comes with 8 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage space. The 8 GB RAM is enough to handle any processes that we do with phone now a days. I would say it is perfect. And the 128 GB of RAM is also enough according to me.
Snapdragon 845 is enough to handle any high graphics gaming. The processor is very powerful and it is also enough for all activities with a blazing fast response.
3. BATTERY : -
One plus 6T comes with a 3700 mAh lithium - polymer battery. The battery performance is unexpected and excellent. I am an old one plus user, I had one plus 3T before this phone and the battery performance is greatly improved. The standby battery performance is also impressive, it takes not more than 1% charge to stay on standby whole night. The battery lasts longer than I expected.
4. CAMERA : -
It comes with a 16MP + 20 MP dual back camera and a 16 MP front camera. Camera is fine but is not upto the level of other flagships. The night mode is poor. Otherwise camera is okay to capture pictures.
5. FINGERPRINT SENSOR : -
The on screen Fingerprint is a very popular feature now a days in expensive smartphones. But it is not that fast in comparison to off screen Fingerprint sensors. It takes a lot of time to unlock, I started hating it now. I think they should work on making it fast. It comes with a cheap firey effect which doesn't look good to me personally.
6. PERFORMANCE : -
The major disappointed I am facing on this phone that, it hangs a lot. It hangs while I am using it like old Samsung phones. This is very frustrating. It hangs while I use utility apps, I am also going to report this to them. I didn't expect it to hang like that. Otherwise performance is fast and impressive, but I will give 0 stars on performance due to the random hangs/lags. I will give them 5 star only if they solve this problem.
MY EXPERIENCE : -
My overall experience of using this phone is satisfactory. Inspite of the random hangs all things are close to perfect. Battery life, fast charging, gaming experience, normal usage experience everything is great.
Overall it is a good, I mean best phone in this price range. I brought it at 28k INR. I think it is a great deal. I am very happy with this phone.
If you are looking to buy this phone, congrats you are on right track.

OnePlus 6T,5,Honest Review...,Camera is not too good. But if we talk about processor it's mind blowing no lag problem while playing high graphics game 8 gigs of ram is plenty to explore more than other device.. snapdragon 845+ performance  amazing.. camera 20+16 Mp is good but it's shows you real image not like oppo nd vivo (just bcz of software help) one+ has no software customized function.. so if you have clear skin it shows that if you have dark circle and pimples it shows them as well.. but if you a gamer thn go for it. Display is Optic amoled which is more than super amoled.  M giving 5 star coz of battery processor display and glass finishing which make it premium smartphone..

OnePlus 6T,1,"Works good for 8-10 months only, thereafter a useless product","Stirred by the hype this phone created at launch, I gave into purchasing one. initially, the phone worked good performance and battery wise though the portrait mode of the camera didn't work for my phone nearly from the beginning itself...  Anyway, I continued using since there were not any major hangs or outages. meanwhile parallelly I was coordinating with their support team for the camera issue...
But after like 7-8 months the performance declined too, the apps, screens started getting stuck, there were 1-2 incidents of complete shutting down too
now I'm sitting at 11th month since purchase, - the camera is totally dead, not of use anymore, (phone hangs the moment I open it), the browsing is not smooth anymore - keeps getting stuck
I've visited the support store too - they ask me to flush entire phone - I try to take backup on my mac but due to one reason or another it never gets completed and gets stuck at 98-99%
All over, the phone really impressed me for initial 3-4 months but now I'm more of stuck like a sitting duck with it - can't upgrade because invested pretty good amount and not even used for 1 year, also unable to get it reviewed or repaired
i'm now just biding my time, adjusting with minimal usage - till I can return to a more trustworthy Samsung or apple clan."

OnePlus 6T,5,Meaning less discount,"There is no meaning to discount... I bought it in may 19 and the price never went up again... 7pro launched in May... I have returned it.... and got 7 pro...
Don't make customers ullu...."
OnePlus 6T,3,Far from perfect,"Writing this review after using the product for around 7 months.
I will first write about the shortcomings. Screen quality and display is not worth the price. It's good but similar quality of display can be seen in even sub-15000 RS smartphones. Night mode on the phone is really poor.After unlocking the phone,it takes 2-3 seconds to fully activate night mode.Even in Redmi 7 , a 6000 rs phone, night mode works instantly. Display calibration is also unsatisfactory and phone contnues to display and yellowish tone in any setting.
Phone hasn't been able to utilise the notch space adequately and left side of notch remains vacant even when right side is crowded.
Camera quality is certainly not flagship. Daylight photos are good but in low light conditions, photos  dont justify the price. I installed gcam which has led to huge improvement.
Audio quality is again average and volume is pretty low even after reaching max. I don't know why they have punched two speakers when only one of them works.  Kind of a fraud honestly
It's true that oxygen OS is clean and clutter free but certain features are required to make it more functional such as option to copy OTP when SMS comes to Mobile. When I click on any contact, it doesn't show me my call history with that contact and I have to call that contact and cut it before it rings to see call history which is so annoying.
While browsing twitter,I open any website using inbuilt chrome (within twitter) and when I start scrolling up and down , the chrome extention crashes every single time and I have to kill the twitter and restart it again.
Vibration is pretty weak.
Among good things I found was it's good battery life, fast face unlock , HD call quality."

OnePlus 6T,5,Good,Good
OnePlus 6T,5,Awesome üëå,As always best product
OnePlus 6T,5,OnePlus is awsome,Awsome
OnePlus 6T,1,Is it seller or brand to blame?,"Extremely disappointed with the phone, i was dreaming about it from a very long time and bought it in July. But to my surprise this phone iturns into blank screen all of a sudden for no reason. Also screen has running multi color patches moving top to bottom some times. The amount I invested on this phone is pretty high to my budget but it's quality and performance has disappointed me."
OnePlus 6T,4,Handsome phone,I given one star less because within short duration new models arrived in market .
OnePlus 6T,4,Overall review after 1 month of usage,Battery life is impressive and face unlock is too good when compare to galaxy S10..but its performance for gaming is not so good for a hardcore gamers. The gameplay gets choppy after 2 hours of gaming
OnePlus 6T,5,Good phone,"Good phone but it hangs when i use Bluetooth. Also, finger print scanner is slow."

The first photo usually has poor colours but from 2nd photo onwards the camera at least works well. Deleting text also does not work properly in many apps. When you press delete or backspace button then instead of single letter sometimes whole paragraph or mail body gets deleted. And then the phone needs to be rebooted.
All in all it is disappointing."

OnePlus 6T,1,Disappointed with OnePlus device after years. Alert slider stopped working within one month.,"Bought this phone with lots of expectations after continuous usage of one plus series devices.
But withing 35 days the alert slider has stopped working where I came to know it is inbuilt in the display so display need to be replaced.
So tell me by investing RS 42000/- would you like to get it repaired in just 35 days from purchase.
Really worst experience ever with OnePlus.
Firstly the package and deliver part was fine.
But in the box I have noticed "" This device is manufactured by Oppo "" which was shocking to me.
When came to the performance and Look part:
Phone is really good looking with sleeky finishing.
Good speed of operating.
But really disappointed with Rear Camera quality.
It's really not upto the mark, I felt13 MP camera was better than this device camera output.
Highly disappointed with Rear camera which was my big expectation while choosing it.
So later after using I found in between some times I have received system notifications saying ""Android stopped responding"" and some hanging while accessing some applications. Which I have seen first time in OnePlus, really surprising and disappointing.
Moreover the alert slider which was my favorite options in the OnePlus devices has stopped working.
I have contacted service center and got to know that display need be replaced where that alert slider is associated with display in built.
It is just 38 days old device and I am really disappointed with it.
Overally very bad experience with OnePlus device for the first time.
Invested 42000/- on it but really disappointed with it's performance and the problem it has given with alert slider. And also with Rear camera quality."

Screen is good too. You can watch 1080p HD content on Netflix. And 1080p resolution content on YouTube.
Camera is on a low side. Selfie and rear camera can give good photos only in day and natural lighting conditions but don't expect anything in low lighting conditions. Low light photos are pathatic.
You will get regular updates every month. Which is good.
Dual sim with dual 4G works great.

OnePlus 6T McLaren Edition boasts of dual primary camera of 16 + 20 megapixel and 16 megapixel front Camera. The Smartphone is also loaded with Optical Image Stablization.

OnePlus 6T,1,Screen gets disabled multiple times,"Using for almost a year now, the phone goes into disabled mode at random time. Sometimes it does not event come back after rebooting, gone to the service center multiple times due to this issue but they do not have a permenant solution for it.
My first purchase of one plus phone and highly disappointed.
Not recommended at all."

OnePlus 6T,5,so far so good,so far so good  - but bit expensive
OnePlus 6T,1,Worst choice made to buy such pathetic phone,"The battery drains out within a very short while, even if not being used. Almost twice to thrice needs to be charged in a day. The storage looks more kind of fake numbers, extremely high consumption. Voice isn't audible on calls to the other person. Guess problem with the mic. Customer service is of no help. In simple words, it's a waste of money on a product which is not worth a buy. Pathetic!!"

OnePlus 6T,1,Disappointed with 2 months old OnePlus 6T!,"It's annoying when phone automatically plays some random songs from musical apps.  Also, frequently turns gaming mode, airplane mode, and torch on while speaking to the other person.  In fact, the battery also drains faster than other one plus models.  Now, I'm looking for a service center which is nearby Kolathur, Chennai, as it can't be return to Amazon.  I'm posting these comments here to get some help from Amazon or OnePlus community."

OnePlus 6T,2,Cheat or Fraud?,"I am a big admirer of 1 Plus phones...first set I bought 1 Plus 3 T, 2 years back......many of my colleagues n friend's followed me....... I Bought 1 Plus 6T @ 37K.... Witihin a month they launched 1 Plus 7 Series@ 32 K..... Feeling some what cheated.
Now 1 Plus 3 T screen display is bursted.... When I called to customer care I come to know that it will cost me 7 K more to make it OK.... Now I am Happy I will be having One plus 3T Whuch will cost me equivalent to ONE PLUS 7...... If u check with One plus Community ...u will find many of them are having same problem, specifically with 3T & 5 T..... because of Operating system upgradations and  these two models are not able to combat with....so all of a sudden such problems arises.
Now I am not sure even after investing 7 K more still this new Screen display of 3Twill be compatible to New upgraded system or not."

OnePlus 6T,5,Awesome Device with Superb User Experience,"Best thing about this device has to be the Oxygen OS. One of the best user experience amongst the Android devices.
Build Quality is absolutely phenomenal and I simply love the carbon fibre texture beneath the glass with the tinge of McLaren orange across the borders. Wish this design to be carried forward in newer devices too. Charging speed with Warp charger is indeed something that will keep you happy throughout.
Camera is more than decent but still feels a bit of improvement is required although pictures in daylight are fantastic, and portrait mode is pretty cool however lowlight photography could have been better.
Being a Limited Edition, it really comes in special packaging with a wonderful box. Overall a great Value for money spent, although this McLaren Edition is bit pricey but still worth having a limited edition device."

OnePlus 6T,4,Not worth the upgrade form Oneplus 6,"Pros:
Better display
Longer battery life
As fast as it gets in the Android ecosystem
Cons:
In-display fingerprint works eight out of ten times
No 3.5mm headphone jack
The secondary camera has no real use whatsoever
Verdict:
The OnePlus 6T is basically the OnePlus 6 with a smaller notch, bigger battery and an in-display fingerprint sensor. It doesn‚Äôt make sense for the present users for the OnePlus 6 to upgrade at all."

WhatsApp interface keep on stopping even after updating system update from OnePlus for August 2019, now disabled biometric security feature in WhatsApp but no effect.

OnePlus 6T,5,Phone is amazingly beautiful and blazing fast.,"Needless to say, phone is amazingly beautiful and fast when it comes to usage. Battery lasts for a day easily with moderate use. Camera is one of the best.
But to my fortune, my One Plus 6T was stolen just after 1.5 months of buying. But I had to pay the EMI for 3 months whatsoever. So be careful while opting for an expensive phone if you are using public transports more often."

Issues: Battery keeps draining without much use. Has been built with less care since company was in hurry to get 7/7t out. Gallery access to recent downloaded stuff is invisible.Gaming mode fails Chromecast relay. Graphics processing isn't that great, simple games crash or flicker. Finger print sucks, as the camera isn't that affective reading the lines."

OnePlus 6T,5,Bought it 10 months ago 3-4 months from there price drops -10k,Phone is great in every segment just the fingerprint reader is a drawback
OnePlus 6T,2,Average camera with a below average battery. Avoid buying if you can,"The camera is so average,  the pictures turn out so dull and the lens fails to capture details. The front camera in my phone was defective. Both rear and front cameras are not worth the hype. The battery is weak,  even the new phone can't sustain beyond 12 to 14 hours.
Scrolling up and down,  right and left is smooth. It looks sexy and expensive.
One more interesting thing I found was that the phone is out of stock on most days,  but when they have sale like the 15 August sale or some other special day,  the phones are suddenly available.  I suspect they are selling faulty,  defective phones during sale period."

OnePlus 6T,3,Okayish,"Using this phone from last few months and here are my reviews over it:
Design : Premium design and sturdy body.
Camera : Amazing camera with regular updates to enrich camera quality.
Battery : With dash charger it takes around 45min for full charge, but while gaming even full charge got consumed within 2hr.
Fingerprint reader : Worst I have ever used. Although it comes with on-screen reader, even after adding same finger 6-7times  in different angle this phone 90% of times fails to recognise that finger and usually take 4-5 attempts to open.
Face recognition: quick but if kept sensors active, battery drains faster.
Gaming : whatever game or app there is, this phone runs it like charm.
Overall good buy under 25k."

OnePlus 6T,5,The almost perfect phone!,"My first OnePlus phone and I'm really impressed by this brand...the Camera is excellent ( shoots up to 4k @60 FPS), has an awesome OIS which stabilises your video footage almost like a gimbal (but it doesn't work so well at higher resolution) . If you vlog, this phone is perfect for you
The front camera is also great .. I love the portrait and nighttime mode .
The sound is very good ..louder than my laptop at full volume .
Inbuilt apps like offline Google assistant ,Alexa and Kindle etc are great.
The battery lasts several hours !
The only issues I have faced is with the fingerprint reader which is slower than my old phone and the Facebook messenger keeps crashing quite often.
I hope they solve these issues in the updates and the next models"

OnePlus 6T,5,Worth it for rupees 27999.,This product is good. Fingerprint can be more faster. Battery life is not too good. Camera quality is designed well.
OnePlus 6T,5,Its nice,Nice product
OnePlus 6T,4,Awesome produce.,"First of all my previous phone was Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime.
For me this was a luxurious buy. The cover itself was pretty dope. The contents were just the essentials but for me that was enough. I have a Samsung level U so that port thing didn't make much of a difference to me.
The resolution was great. Very rich and alive.
The sound quality was over the roof! Seriously, even the base can be heard. Clarity is above average and distortion is very less noticeable, the earphones on full volume don't produce distortion unless the quality of the audio is low.
The carema was mind blowing, especially after the update the camera was great, even after zooming the pixelation is very less noticeable.
I used to play an RPG (Elder scrolls) and an MMORPG(PubG Mobile) on the highest graphics. Didn't lag but phone does get heated up very much after 7-8 rounds of PubG. The Elder scrolls doesn't heat up the phone much. The gaming mode really is a blessing, especially after the new update. No notifications to disturb you and the network and RAM is boosted up.
Every other app runs flawlessly, I don't use social apps much tho.
Battery gets charged within an hour. Pubg does drain your battery quickly, mind you. But it gets charged really soon.
TIP: If in a hurry, put your cell on airplane mode, 10% to 100% within 40 mins.
The night mode does save battery, doesn't cause much irritation to eyes.
The reading mode is something great for me. I read stuffs regularly and this mode doesn't cause headaches and eye aches as it does normally. (I usually end up reading for 3-4 hours)
That's it folks. Hope it helps you with buying. ;-)

OnePlus 6T,5,Best phone at the time.,Oneplus 6t was one of the best phones at the time of my purchase and I must say I am still extremely happy with it. It's extremely smooth and fast the camera quality is amazing and I could and I still think I could not get a better phone at that time. Really wanted to to buy the oneplus 7 pro when it came out but the oneplus 6t  had almost all of the features anyway. It's the first time about oneplus product and I must say I am very happy with it.

OnePlus 6T,5,IPhone killer,"You can never go wrong with OnePlus phones. The quick charging is amazing. They keep on improving the quick charging capabilities for each interaction. It's better than 3T.
Low light photography is amazing.
You can find lots of great reviews.
They pre-apply screen guard.
Also, they provide free cover
One problem which I have is they don't provide earphones.
I think they should have bullet as part of the package.
They should like earlier to spend less money on marketing and spend more money on improving the package contents, research, and improvements to the software.
Word of mouth is better than any marketing."
OnePlus 6T,5,Awesome. Loved it,One of the best premium phones at this price range and OnePlus sure has been a tyrant in phones.
OnePlus 6T,3,Service( care ) of no use.,Phone is good but There service care is of no use. app servify is of no use. There is a facility that they will pick phone from ur address repaire it then deliver back to ur home. Hahaha this is just a myth. They will not pick ur phone and make excuses all the time. Simply care service is of no use. Think before purchasing if anything happen to ur phone either they will loot u or will not provide service.

OnePlus 6T,5,Worth it!,Good build quality. Feels good in the hand. The complementary back cover is really protects the phone again any accidental drop.

OnePlus 6T,5,Phone,Good phone in some aspects
OnePlus 6T,5,Amazing phone,"I'm reviewing this after almost one month. Phone is fabulous. I bought it for 28k in july 2019. 8GB ram 128 GB ROM mirror black.
Battery life is awesome. I have checked it with Battery History app. To drain 1% by continuous use it takes Almost 10 min. But while playing pubg for 1 % battery it takes 3 minutes. In night if u r not using like if u r sleeping, so to drain 1% battery it takes almost 2 to 3 hrs and that is amazing. Camera quality is awesome. Everything is working fine and smooth."

OnePlus 6T,4,Nice product,Its Good Phone
OnePlus 6T,5,Good product,Nice work
OnePlus 6T,5,Value for money,good camera quality. battery backup reduced after 3months usage.best at this price.
OnePlus 6T,3,Average product for Expensive Price.,"One plus 6T suppose to be one of the best product in market but below is my experience after 8 months of Use.
1. Camera is below Average for price I paid. Nightmode never works smoothly. 80% camera application was crashed. Rest of the pics are also captured like ordinary phones. I feel MI phones are better with camera in price range they come.
2. Worst fingerprint scanner seen ever for premium price I paid.
3. Built quality is good. OS is also good.software response lags sometimes. Built in wallpapers are so poor and depressing.
4. Battery life was better initially but it is reduced with the time. However dash charge works faster.
5. it is sad that later versions of one plus are priced cheaper than this expensive average phone. This could have been priced below 30K. Felt cheated.
6. It was my mistake to move to one plus from Apple, as it does not hold any brand value.
7.resell value is also very low. And no buyers for your old expensive shit.
8. I would say.. one plus is not reliable option to replace your Apple device. Stretch your budget and go for apple."

OnePlus 6T,5,Awesome!!!,"After switching from Samsung to OnePlus and using it for 30 days.. the product is amazing in terms of battery.. camera.. sound.. OS.. buttery smooth.. display.. call quality.. everything.. will fulfill your expectations.. BUT.. compared to Samsung's Display I must say Smsung is having way better display to OnePlus in terms of color reproduction and brightness.. and also the build quality for ringer button is not paid enough attention as iPhone did.. and keeping in mind its 6th Gen from OnePlus.. they must have worked on Display, ringer and also VIBRATION MOTOR (Haptic Feedback).. Overall product is Awesome for current price (27,999/-) and would like to see few improvements from OnePlus in near future.."
OnePlus 6T,4,A Reliable Gadget,"The phone is a neat package. Its a jack of all trades, master of only one. Yes, master chipset. The Snapdragon 845. It manages all your functionality like a strong Irish Sailor.
This has made the battery life stay one step ahead of any phone with these specs. Not once, not twice but thrice since I got this phone have I ever needed to charge this phone in less than 36 hours.
I believe the Hz on the new Oneplus 7 pro is so good you are quicker than a McLaren with your fingers but this phone has never given me a chancr to complain.
The Camera has given me doubts several times. I dont know if its a model issue or if it is what it is. Never been very impressed with every picture but some.
The sound output from the mono speaker is shreaky at high volumes and can get uneasy to the ear. Best heard at half volume. Sad it doesnt have a headphone jack. You are provided with a C-type headphone jack converter in the box which converts just about decent sound through a wired earphone. Phone is best with Bluetooth devices.
Fingerprint is fast enough and just accurate for an in fingerprint sensor. Animation a nice touch.
The toggle switch is a great boon for anyone who needs a quick shift between settings during your day. A strong and precise switchery.
Overall, it is a package that you should not avoid."

OnePlus 6T,1,Cheap hardware and extreme expensive parts.,"First of all..i was very big fan of OnePlus.. Have owned 1 one plus 6, 2 OnePlus 6t and 1 OnePlus 7.. All was going perfect until I have got this experience..I am very particular about maintaing my mobile phone. Not a single scratch on my mobile phone. Two days ago, i have connected my OnePlus on charging and suddenly charging stopped..i have tried with different OnePlus charge but nothing happened.. So i assumed that my charging port is faulty and went to OnePlus service center.. After checking they told me that my charging port is fine but voltage is not passing from charging port to mother board, so they have to replace mother board and cost for the same is Rs. 21000. I was shocked to know but when I asked for reason they said that there is no reason for this, it happens due to voltage fluctuations.i said that i have 5 mobile at home and charging them at my place, so far nothing happened. They just simply refuse to entertain me. Also i met one customer at service center who owned OnePlus 7 and bought it a week ago faced problem with camera and they told him that it's an hardware issue and not covered in warranty.. My request to you all that even if the mobile looks fantastic but it lags high quality hardware and it can go bad any time.. And as per there service policy, they will replace mother board, as all circuits are not independent and they can't repair anyone of it. It will cost you a lot.. If you are planning to buy, just visit there service center and observe.."

I wanted to buy the new One+ 7 / Pro ( But i am not much fan of the pop-up camera and for the price they are selling it its not justifying the features it has i.e. its  lacking wireless charging, water resistant etc.) So I went for 6T which i a) got at a cheap deal and b) has the review of being the best One+ phone till date.."
OnePlus 6T,4,Display isn't that worthy.,Display quality regards breaking is not that good. My phone's display got cracked just falling from 2 ft height. New display cost is 80000/-. In that amount I can buy a new smartphone. Just one cons is there. Otherwise it's a fab phone.

3: Worst tracking facility and SMS Updates.
4: Worst packaging as there was no extra box to cover the mobile box. The box got damaged ( uploaded the pic with this review). As I am a Mobile Phone lover it hurts me so much.
Writing review after 20 days of usage.
Pros:
1. Amazing build quality
2. Amazing cameras
3. Amazing display quality.
4: Great performance.
Cons:
1. No FM radio support.

So...Good"
OnePlus 6T,5,Love,Awesome one
OnePlus 6T,5,Nice mobile,Really nice so far and really fast..
OnePlus 6T,4,Not worthy,The headphone usage needs immediate attention as the voice repeats and echoes on calls when attached. Has to be detached every minute while on call to stop it but continues even after it. Fingerprint sensor needs a bit more swiftness. Battery needs attention coz not so heavy usage also drains it too early.
OnePlus 6T,5,...,No words for oneplus too good mobile
OnePlus 6T,5,Value for money,Excellent piece
OnePlus 6T,4,Excellent.,"I am satisfied with the product, the problem I am facing is the battery life only, fingerprint is adequate and working fine, I have seen and used one plus 7 so not that fast but still better than the competitors. Pictures are marvelous, nightscape mode brightens the image but quality is not good because if we zoom it ww can notice ot easily.
Blazing fast it is, no lag whatsoever. Switching between the apps no problem. And while talking about battery life, there is dash charging for you.
Just go, buy and enjoy it."

OnePlus 6T,4,"Great phone to have at this price, enjoyable exp.","After using for more the 2 months all i can say one plus 6t is awesome phone
Display is vibrant and quick to rsponse almost full hd display with little notch.
Camera quality is awesome pictures are quite awesome and look naturals , night mode camera is pretty much ok in this price range.
Game experience is also great their no lag while playing heavy games like pub g and at full hd grafics.
Look of one plus is premium and its mirror back panel is give awesome feel and finish , quite slim phone but bit heavier and large display some time need to use both hands to rach from one end to other.
Battery life is pretty good one can easly spend full day with heavy use and fast charging is a plus , one plus charge can charge the phone pretty quickly this is one of the best think I have ever come across .
In display finger print sensor is pretty good but some time annoying , one plus need to improve performacr of indisplay finger print sensor, its some time lag or not recoganise the finger, but face unlock is pretty fast and reponsive.
Overall great phone to have in this prife with all the premium features.
By d way I bought 8GB 128 internal mirror black  varient..."

Observations
Pros
-Good battery backup
-Warp charging is ""God sent""
-Amazing display
-Camera is good
-Seeing this is the first variant of OnePlus for in-display fingerprint sensor it was a good try
-Profile slider for general, silent and vibrate is amazing
-Have not seen any glitches so far
-Heavy battery optimisation (looking at is as a pro for me)
Cons
-A hell lot of screenshots taken because of the display to the right of the screen is alligned exactly opposite to the volume down key on the left side
-Missing led notification
-Indisplay fingerprint works 8 out of 10 times and is kind of slow in comparison to the OnePlus 7 and pro
-Could have done a better work with the camera quality
- No IPS rating
Overall it an amazing buy at the end of it because of its steady and reliable built inside as well as outside."

It's camera is not as per expectations and even xiomi's phones have fast fingerprint reader. After giving such price you can't expect you will get this phone. I extremely dislike this phone and the reason is simple that it's features are not justifying the price tag.

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Awesome phone. Big thanks to OnePlus.,"Honest Review for One Plus 7 Pro :
It's my first one plus phone(12GB RAM, 256GB ROM) which I bought 4 months back and I am quite happy with the design and performance of it. I will try to cover most of the positive and negative aspects of the phone.
Pros :
1. Speed - I have used mobile phone of every company and I must say it has the best performance ever. Apps opened in just fraction of seconds.
2. Display - It has been a wonderful experience of using 90 hertz display which makes it more superior than other mobile phone displays.
3. Camera - Stability of the camera is very good even you are recording video in moving vechicle.
4. Notchless display - One of the coolest feature of this phone is it's full screen display without any notch which gives user an amazing experience.
5. Battery - Currently, this phone has a battery back up of one and a half day. Will update it after completing 1 year.
6. Fast Charging - It will take your phone to get full charge from 0 to 100 percent in just 1 hour 20 minutes. And in half an hour, it will charge your phone above 50 percent.
Cons :
1. Quite Heavy - As I have used number of phones I personally find it quite heavy which is due to hardware they have provided. But now I am habitual to it.
2. Auto Brightness - Sometimes I feel the auto brightness feature doesn't works well. So in that case I have to manually adjust the brightness. May be oneplus can fix this issue in the upcoming software updates.
3. Night mode in camera - Night mode of the camera is not that good as compared to other phones. It could be more better. May be this can also be fixed in next software update.
4. Price - Upto OnePlus 6T the price of the phones were nearly 35k. This is the first phone which costs nearly 50k. Quite overpriced but value for money.
5. No IP rating - Although company claims that it is water resistant but ip rating must be given by company for such a flagship phone.
6. Glass panel - The phone is very slippery if you are using it without cover and back panel can easily break. Therefore, I suggest to have a good case to protect.
7. No 3.5 mm jack - You have to compromise with the 3.5 mm audio jack if you want to purchase this phone. I sometimes feel there must be 3.5mm jack but then I use bluetooth earphones.
To sum up, although there are number of disadvantages but still this phone is value for money. I hope this review will be helpful."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,"Not even the best for money, it's just the best phone available at the moment!","The phone is phenomenal. I'm writing the review after approximately 3 weeks of usage. Not once has the phone glitched or lagged. OxygenOS, which is the default Stock OS that the phone comes installed with, is silky smooth and has no rough edges at all - everything is well polished! I may switch to LineageOS at some point in the future, if updates stop, but I don't really feel the need to, at the moment. The phone's camera is really phenomenal and performs well in low light conditions too. The display, with no ridiculous notch, is a joy to use, and is absolutely the best display I have ever seen on a phone - the 90Hz refresh rate provides a level of smoothness for animations that one needs to experience first hand to describe.
Gaming performance is stellar - the phone enters gaming mode when you begin a game (Riptide ftw!) and also provides you the optional ""Fnatic Mode"" in case you need an extra graphics performance boost - which has not really been necessary at all so far. I'm amazed by all the negative reviews - I don't buy phones often, my last phone was the OnePlus One which I have now been using for 5.5 years (still works fine, just running a teensy-weensy bit slow now, despite the brilliance that is LineageOS), so I take my time to make a decision to buy a new phone. Haven't had a single issue so far <fingers crossed, of course>. The iridescent blue back is absolutely stunning - the phone is a real looker - and the motorised pop-up camera works absolutely perfectly with no issues at all. The in-display fingerprint scanner is a joy to use - there is really nothing faster out there, at the moment. The next generation of OnePlus phones is probably going to have a hole-punch front camera - so that display is really not going to be able to match up to the amazing full-screen expanse that is present on this one - so you should really, really, probably buy this phone if you can afford it (Saved up for 5 years ;) )"
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Best in this price segment.,"Go for it without any hesitation. Everything is perfect except battery life, coz you have to charge it twice a day, if you are a heavy user, otherwise phone runs a day without any problem"
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Its a beast,"Overall it is a beast... But still some things are not up to the mark. The images in low light is not up to the mark. Picture was more smooth under lowlights than sharp. Battery life could have been bit more. It may be because of the high end specifications too.
Overall too happy with the mobile"

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,"First flagship, proud for my decision","My previous device was Vivo V9.  I start regretting from the first day of V9 and then I made a promise to myself to never purchase a Vivo or Appo device.
Finally, after a lot of thinking, I purchased this with my tight budget but I never regret this decision even it costed me a fortune.
Pros:-
1. Fastest, never hangs (except for the 2nd day of purchase, which usually happens with oneplus).
2. Display is the best thing about this device. I can't get over looking the screen and my gf feel jealous of it.
3. With 90Hz refresh rate, phone looks much faster (well now I hate using other devices, they seems too slow).
4. Rear camera is good, works well in day as well as in night with night scape mode (though night mode is pain in the a..)
5. Phone looks and feel very premium.
6. Fast charging with Wrap is lightning.
7. Software is the next best thing
9. Loudspeakers are really awesome.
10. Screen finger print gets faster with day to day uses, Haptic Vibration is very good, Alert slider is very convenient.
Cons:-
1. Front camera is poor but this is expected from a pop-up camera.
2. Battery backup is very poor and worse if you use 90hz with UHD display.
The only thing I'm disappointed from is the price drop. It hurts like hell when you purchase one on the actual price and few months after it gets discounted. Price should be constant on oneplus devices."

I had to literally Google to check if there are other folks facing the similar issues and to my surprise there were plenty. I have used 5T and 6T both and I never faced this issue but it's completely annoying and disappointing that a phone would die like this on just the second day. Additionally I didn't quite like the battery life, even when I am not using it, the phone seems to be losing a lot of charge. The other issue I faced was I tried the smart Lock feature and used my finger print lock and also the pattern lock. The fone would automatically lock itself even when I am watching you tube or using the fone. This was like annoying to the heights. I had selected the screen time for 5 mints but still the fone would auto lock within seconds. I was so annoyed so I removed all the lock system off"

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,OnePlus team please resolve the issue ASAP!,The battery is literally dropping like a number count down. it wasn't that good before too now after updating it .

Both battery life and camera quality are awesome. Hats off to amezon for providing such a awesome phone at a reasonable price and for such speed delivery.
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Just awesome.,Reviewing after 6 months of use. Everything is still awesome.
OnePlus 7 Pro,3,Hugely overrated,"Lets be honest, One plus 7 pro is touted to be a flagship camera phone. I purchased this after 4 years of Honor 7 use. And the first thing I noticed about it was a shockingly below average camera app. I has no fill light flash option, no flash in Pro mode. A very narrow range of manual focus. It‚Äôs PDAF is virtually blind in low light conditions. Inconsistent white balance in well-lit conditions. No AI mode like Xiaomi phones.
However, Display is mind blowing. Sound quality is almost as good. Fast but RAM management is not optimised. Battery backup is decent. Heats up quite a bit after watching videos more than 20 mins.
If given a chance, I‚Äôd happily switch to Huawei mate 20 pro. Google or no google Huawei phones have excellent hardware optimisation and a very handy camera app."
OnePlus 7 Pro,1,Brand new phone asking to reboot the system.Ref video,"Phone is not processing ahead seems like refurbished phone has been give.. Asking to reboot the system again... Have uploaded the video of whole process.

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,The best phone in this world.,"The best phone in this world at present. This one is awesome phone. I always bought only phones in 10k range because they provided everything and lasted easily 2 years. But I have only one life and I wanted to experience a flagship phone. So I bought this, and I am so happy. It is an eye Turner, the shiny glass back and the pop up selfie camera and the one plus logo itself. So people ask me the cost of this phone when they see it. Believe it people, OnePlus is the real status in today's world, not apple because their starting prices are same. Everything is good about this phone. I want to use this phone for atleast 5 years. I would be so happy if OnePlus provided security updates for 3 years instead of 2 years."

OnePlus 7 Pro,4,OnePlus 7 Pro,"Over all it is a good phone. Upgrading from oneplus 3t to oneplus 7 Pro. Battery life is the best thing which I felt in this mobile. But there are a few problems with this phone which I encountered in nearly one month of usage.
1) Fingerprint scanner not working sometimes :  I do not know whether it is happening to others as well, but when I try to unlock the phone, sometimes the fingerprint scanner is disabled and I have to use the pattern to unlock the screen. It happened a lot in this first one month of the usage.
2) Camera is over beautifying the  pics taken. Most of the times when you click a photo, you looks over beautified than the actual person. The depth of the photo is getting compromised in this way. slightly dark colored people like me will get a shook  when you see the first photo of yourself. :D.  Also pics taken from the ultra wide lens are distorted when you zoom a little bit."

OnePlus 7 Pro,3,An avarage phone,After nearly two months of usage I got a fair idea now the performance is avarage. Battery dries out very fast. If you are typing in anything in a app. Suddenly the app closes automatically. Finger readers sometimes need 2 to 3 touches to work. Camera is excellent as expected. Much more was expected as this was a pro model. But every avarage performance. Fixes should be provided to overcome issues.

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,beautiful and magnificent,"Charming colour

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Awesome All rounder,"An awesone all rounder. The 3 camera system provides good flexibility for shots. The consistency between the 3 camera lenses is spectacular and unlike any Xaomi triple camera setup. The warp charging is super fast and charges the phone from 50% to 100% in about 25 mins. Battery life is okayish on heavy usage it drains down to 40% after a day's use that too in 60 hz, at 90 hz battery drain is faster. OnePlus should have provided a larger capacity battery. That is the only con, I found in this device. Call quality and cellular reception is excellent. You cannot go wrong with this device. Also, a backcover is a must for this device, as it is full glass body, super slippery, and a fingerprint magnet."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,I would like to have Another Oneplus Phone again.,Very good user experience. Oxygen Os is just above of stalk Android. I love this phone. It is my favorite till now. I also like my OnePlus 6T.

OnePlus 7 Pro,1,Defected Device,"I would be more than happy if someone help me to report all issues i am facing with device to one plus 7 pro authority.
I think the device i am using is not up to the mark as it's performance is very poor as compared to OnePlus6,  OnePlus6t, OnePlus7 and other OnePlus7Pro,  may be it's defected piece.
Everytime while using almost every application like FB,  Netflix or any other the device is getting freeze and personally i don't think so that is common for oneplus device when you have 256GB ROM and 8GB RAM out of which 100GB is available to use.
My friends who are using OnePlus6,  6t or OnePlus7 giving them better performance as compared to my device i. e.  OnePlus7Pro.
Camera quality for my device is very poor,  unclear and not up to the mark.
Portrait feature is not working properly."
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,"One Plus 7 Pro - OS, Performance, Tripple and Pop-Up Camera and Battery is Simply Awesome.","Just bought this in Rs.38,700 by availing 10% cashback offer at https://amzn.to/35F6NVw.
Simply an excellent build quality. Not too sleek or slippery. So far using this for couple of weeks and battery performance is amazing. Can't find words to describe how cool the processing works. Also, 3 cameras are awesome. Clicked images look really good and clear. Pop-up camera for selfies works fine.
Frankly speaking, never been a fan of an Android phone. Also, never thought of any other smartphone could possibly challenge iPhone processing and camera features. But now, today One Plus 7 Pro beat me to it.
Anyways, some PROS and CONS wanted to share before you buy this item:
PROS:
1. Obviously, it comes up with the latest and greatest hardware.
2. Amazing display quality and the curved edged display.
3. Smooth Android experience with an Oxygen OS version.
4. Quickest charging I've ever seen.
5. Excellent macro, depth-effect, bla bla modes in the camera.
6. Pop-up camera works excellent.
CONS:
1. Sometimes, it misses with details. Not everyone can see this, but those who are photoshop geeks could guess that.
2. One plus never provide headphones with handset, really disappointed.
3. Feels heavy at times.
4. Once in a while, it does hang, bit annoying."
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,It's a powerful phon,Camara was lag every time I open it.
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Good mobile,Good product
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,You just cannot go wrong !,"First thing first, this is a Supreme Phone.
I got this 8Gb/256Gb version for 40999 ( there were some other offers also - SmartBuy By HDFC made it even a better deal - 2000 worth vouchers more) . This phone justifies the price of 40K. It beats the Samsung and iPhone hands down in Display and aesthetics. Camera is tad bit inferior to Iphone Pro Max and Note 10 but the difference is marginal. Normal user will find it hard to notice the difference. Night Mode has been great with the latest software on.
And yes, the User experience is better than Iphone. It took all these years for and Android phone to trump Apple in that regard. 90Hz refresh rate is not a gimmick, it makes every other mobile phone 'feel' slow.
Battery life is great, lasts a full day with moderate to heavy usage , even with that 4k (90Hz)  screen on. Lord knows how much it will last if it is turned down to 60hz FHD.
Software is on par with iOS as far as usability and touch/feel is concerned. There is no news in  saying that  it is the fastest phone around.
After the price cut it is the most affordable premium phone in the market today. Close your eyes, and go for it - you will not go wrong."
OnePlus 7 Pro,3,Ok phone,"Camera features are very limited.
It gets hang sometimes
Photos get blur in dark"
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Not satisfied,This could be much better.
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Well,Well
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Great,Great phone

OnePlus 7 Pro,2,Worst they won't give you replacement or refund or return,It's a waste phone gets hang sometimes and no return police they will not give replacement or return if ypu buy in onile it's better to an iPhone
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Good product,Just awesome
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,One Of the best phone out there,"Without a shadow of doubt, it's one of the best phone out there. Camera is really good, though they can still make it better. Kudos to OnePlus for launching such amazing products. #OnePlusFan #OnePlusFam"
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Excellent,"Excellent product
Good value for money"
OnePlus 7 Pro,1,"Fragile, Heavy and Slippery","Phone is Heavy, slippery and Fragile. Just after one month, the phone slipped out of my formal trousers while I was sitting on a chair and hit the ground. The screen broke even though it was in proper cover and is Gorilla Glass 5. Screen replacement is very expensive - Rs 16500. Since the screen is curved, it makes the phone even fragile."
OnePlus 7 Pro,1,Worst product from OnePlus,Worst battery ever. Phone hangs most of the time. It isn't a one plus phone i guess. Apart from screen quality nothing is special about the phone

OnePlus 7 Pro,4,?,Product is value for money but not best
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Awesome buy for a butter smooth Android experience,"Awesome product, I recommend everyone to buy the top model at the current discounted price. It is butter smooth performance with Android 10 updated on it. Real value for money product. You don't need the 7T Pro, there is nothing much you can grab out of that 11K additional money from your pocket. Just under 10% performance upgrade, EIS on wide camera module and 85 mAh more battery. Not really neededü§£
On the other side it is a bit slippery in hand due to both sides glass and curved screen (long edges). Actually, if the screen is flat in the same everything else would have been far better. Curved screen is good for none. They should drop that..."

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Best of all the flagships,"Product is wonderful, even delivery is super fast"
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,"Okay, not great, just okay.","It's not the ""flagship killer"" OnePlus would like it to be, but each iteration gets a little closer. It remains to be seen if subsequent models will become serious competition while remaining at the same price point.
As an avid fan of mobile photo/video, this phone is usable but still not quite where I would expect it to be at this price point.
All in all, it's an okay phone for the money, but if you're concerned about having quality computational photography, noise-free/artifact-free video, etc, you're better off going with the Pixel 4 (even my pixel 2 XL takes higher quality photo/video with far lower noise and artifacting) or spending a little more for the Galaxy.
If having high quality photo or video doesn't rank as high on your list of needs then you will very likely really enjoy this phone and for the price I would definitely recommend it.
If high quality photo/video is high on your list of needs, I recommend taking a pass on this phone; It's definitely not for the photo/video enthusiast."

OnePlus 7 Pro,4,4g6h6h,5g5h6h
OnePlus 7 Pro,3,Im not happy with it!!,"Honestly i love iphone and from the reviews and ratings of this product considered me to buy this phone but my previous phone iPhone 7 was too good and i was not too happy with my new android so i gave this oneplus to my sister and bought iPhone 11 and im very happy with my decision.
For me no phone is better than apple iPhone i mean iphones are the leader of phone industry and for this oneplus I don‚Äôt like this phone too much i mean its good for those who likes to live with android."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Phone manufacturing has reached its peak today!!!,"Where do i start! Ok one week down the lane, this phone to begin with looks spectacular, atleast from the screen and display point of view i dont know what could better this now. Next up, The 90hz refresh rate makes your phone feel buttery and you will love it(comes at a negotiable cost of reduced battery life) . It's alright though since it's powered with a WARP charger that works like a charm. Talking about cameras now, pop-up camera adds to the elligence of this phone. The picture qulities are stunning at times. I have tried macro photo graphy with this one and the details it can catch are just terrific to believe. 4k recording is excellent, stability is alright!! At this price (42k) it's almost unreal as to what this phone has to offer. Nebula blue color makes this gadget look like out of this planet. Let's not even get into specification. Because it's all just ""beyond the speed"". One amazing product!!"

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Great Smartphone with awesome user experience.,"It's a great smartphone. What I say, there so many reviews about it's quality. You will fell in love with it the time you start using it. It's been one month for me now. If you want it just buy it. I haven't found a better smartphone experience than One Plus. Oxygen OS is one of the main reason I bought this phone. Before I was using Motorola with Stock Android experience which is good but if you want some good customization without disturbing the simpleness of Stock Android, One Plus is for you. The following Pros and Cons are my experience and doesn't mean everyone will have same.
Pros:
1. A very beautiful display.
2. Camera is top notch.
4. Battery backup is quite good. For me, it's runs for almost one and half day with moderate use.
5. User experience: I have already mentioned above. So buttery smooth.
6. Processing Speed. Having the best available Processor, it is expected to have a great speed and this phone follows that.
7. Quick updates. This is what I love about One Plus. The release updates almost each month. I have updated phone for 3 times after buying in a month.
8. Customization: It gives user to make many simple but useful customizations without disturbing other things.
Cons:
1. In Display Fingerprint Scanner - It could be faster. I think it is little slow as compared to physical Fingerprint Scanners which I have seen in very low cost Xiaomi phones. Sometimes it takes 2-3 touches to unlock. Maybe it will get fixed in next update.
2. When I install a new app, it gets added randomly in side pages of home (I have enabled to put a newly installed app's icon in home screen). New app icon should get added in first available blank area on screen or next to last icon added. But it gets added randomly.
3. Its not a con, but just an experience: It's my 1st phone with curved display, so I find it difficult to use sometimes because you never know which part of hand is touching the curved part, so when you try to use phone at that time, screen doesn't reponses, for example, while scrolling something, it doesn't get scrolled as my left hand's skin below thumb is touching the curved part of  the screen. It almost got resolved when I put on a back cover on it. So better use it with back cover on."

Pros
Display
Camera quality
Flawless handling
Gaming
Cons
Weight
Battery life
Overall
Best mobile experience i have had in my life"
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Amazing phone but...,"There are few things i dont like about this product, first is it's weight, this thing is quite a weight.
Secondly, the camera is good enough for most people, but in low light, unless you use nightscape, the pictures are bad, otherwise the camera is very good (not excellent) in bright light scenes..
Also, the battery is quite nice actually, but the last oxygenOS update ruined the battery life tbh, now it barely last a day, i have to recharge it again by the end of the day, to about 50% (the charging speed is really very very good!! Very fast charger indeed) but i last about 15-20% everyday by the end, PLEASE DO NOTE THAT I USE MY PHONE A LOT THOUGH, üòÇüòÖ SO IF YOU ARE A LIGHT USER, WHO CASUALLY USES YOUR PHONE, YOU CAN EASILY LAST A DAY EVERYDAY ON THIS PHONE, I USE ABOUT 6-7 HOURS EVERYDAY, SO THERE'S THAT...
If u still want a better battery life, you can always turn the screen to 60Hz or maybe even lower the resolution from the settings to get better battery life...
Also the screen is just amazing on this phoneüòçüòçüòç it's just mesmerizing to look at!!!ü•∞ü•∞
The performance also is amazing, haven't noticed even a single hiccup in between using apps or anything like that..!!
Overall, just close your eyes, and book it!!"
OnePlus 7 Pro,3,Decent display and decent phone should not be called as flagship,Decent phone not flagship level except its display
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Overall good perfor,HDR mode on camera not generating a proper color image as it should be. Too much contrast and false color tone.
OnePlus 7 Pro,3,Problem backing up n syncing photos on Google photos,I have been a loyal customer of One Plus.... but the problem I am facing with this phone is that there is no option for cellular/data back up of photos in the backup &Sync section. It only says waiting for wifi. I am clueless what to do about it. This option was clearly available in my previous One Plus phone.
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Superb,Nice
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,One +,Very good device
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,A very good phone at this price point I got this for 35k,"Fingerprint reader is very quick n responsive, camera is decent takes very good picture in day loght, struggle at night, batteeh life is ok ....depends on user if u are a heavy user u might need to top up at evening light user can last a full day without any worry üòä"
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,WOWWWWWWW,Simply .. Awesome Mobile.. Lovely ...
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Good to go...I like the mobile,"Meet my expectations...
But camera quality has to improve..battery life is good for my usage..for gamers it's not sufficient. Sound speaker quality good..Ctype Jack for earphones is the minus..better to use Bluetooth earpods."
OnePlus 7 Pro,1,Poor,Very disappointed.
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Oneplus at its Best.,Oneplus is fine tuning it self year by year. Oneplus 7 pro is one of the best device of this year. It's a all-rounder device. Only cons I feel is the battery back up. It's battery backup is lower due to large and 90hz display and power hungry processor. Although Warp charge helps a lot to charge its battery sufficiently faster than its competitor (Although cheaper Realme x2 pro comes with 50watt Super VooC technology). Beside this everything is top-notch.
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,BEAST AMONGST MOBILE,I LOVED THIS MOBILE
OnePlus 7 Pro,3,Little bit slow,Phone is good. But not up to the expected quality
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Oneplus 7pro,"Fingerprint reader is so good, camera like other phone lastly I use Google pixel and pixel camera is far better, battery life is okay."

You need to carry power bank with you or wrap charger. I doubt, even 30W wrap charger not sufficient.

OnePlus 7 Pro,2,Not value for money,Battry drain too fast
OnePlus 7 Pro,1,Issue with network connection,"For the first time I thought to go for a oneplus product and it brought me nothing but disappointment.
Nowadays almost all (even budget) smartphones provide decent battery life, good camera etc.
Being a flagship smartphone that too worth Rs 53000, it was expected to be much better than just mid range smartphones.
The major issue which I had faced is with the network connectivity. It used to get disconnected from network every now and then(approx after every 5-7 mins) and I had to manually reconnect it by going to settings option. Even when the hotspot was turned on, all the devices which were connected to it used to get disconnected after every 5-10 mins.
Finally I had to sell my oneplus 7 pro at half price and bear a loss of around 25000.
The display quality is average (not at all the best in market). The screen is curved like samsung s9 plus but the display quality is nowhere near samsung flagships.
The only thing which I liked about the 7 pro was the charging speed and decent battery life. But one should not be spending 53000 for just good battery life.
Only Suggestion to #Oneplus would be: instead of bringing out 4-5 same phones per year, work properly on one device so that customers won't be disappointed. Like there is a limit....oneplus 7, oneplus 7 pro, oneplus 7t, oneplus 7t pro...are you crazy ????"
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Amazing product,Amazing product
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Defective item delivered. Got replaced!,"The first time i bought OP7pro. I was shipped with a defective unit. The screen had burn in issues. I just don't get it. If i am the first owner of the phone, how can it have screen burn in. It is something, that develops gradually on prolonged use. Maybe they are selling refurbished ones in offers. I filed for a replacement. And its working great.
The phone is great in all aspects. Just the battery time is a bit less. My unit also registers false touches while charging.
The design is fabulous and fragile. ‚úåÔ∏è
Update-
Initially I gave it a 5star rating, then reduced one for the 3.5mm jack and battery."

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Cool!!!,Coool!!!
OnePlus 7 Pro,2,Not happy with the product,WiFi connection issue
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,One plus 7 pro phon is su.,"Screen is very soft touch, camera quality was great and battery life was so long.."
OnePlus 7 Pro,3,Very average product - not worth the price,"I am writing this review after 40 days of usage. I bought this cell phone after using OnePlus 5 for two and half years. It was working excellently with only one hitch - its battery life suddenly went down very badly. Since it did not happen gradually but over a few days, it seems the conspiracy theory of all major companies doing something to their phones through system updates to force people to upgrade phone may be correct. Coming to One Plus 7 Pro. Well I am not a gamer or a geek - so not the right person to comment on processing speed, multi tasking and all the technical jargon. I use phone as a phone plus watch movies on Prime etc and surfing the usual social media Apps. The phone for me is also my primary camera. When I compare all these activities, I have the following key observations: (1) While using it as a phone, it is below par compared to OnePlus 5 - I hear regular complaints from the persons that I am talking to of not being able to hear me properly (2) On social media usage and interface etc, it is in no way superior to One Plus 5 (3) Camera - No matter what the experts may shout from the rooftops - I can't believe that my two and half year old One Plus 5 still gives better results in almost all normal pictures - portrait, group picture, selfie, landscape, natural scenery, low light etc. Its camera was simple to use and gave much better results (4) In spite of this one having a bigger and much heavier battery, there is no improvement in battery life also (5) The charger remains very strange in shape and size and still doesn't fit well into most electrical sockets (6) There is no headphone jack - so either your old headphones become obsolete or you have buy a connector/ adapter (7) Last but not the least - for a phone like this, it is an obscene amount of money that OnePLus is asking. Oneplus used to a be a flagship killer - giving flagship features at a much lower price. It is no longer the case, the quality is going down and price is not very much in flagship bracket. This is exactly what lead to the downfall of all earlier flagship killers  like Nexus and Moto. After many years, I would now make sure that neither do I buy a OnePLus again, nor would I suggest any person in my circle to shell out 50K odd on this phone as it does not deserve this price tag."
OnePlus 7 Pro,3,Really disappointing with the package deal,"The company is not providing C cable to 2.0mm adaptor ,we are paying a good amount to own this product still if you feel that's something is still missing then it's definitely means that the product is not value for money, either earphones or converter is must in the box...but sorry it's not there... really disappointing"

The phone's 90Hz display is the main thing about it. But only for gaming would you see a stark difference and realise how good it is. If you don't intend on doing that, then no point buying a 90Hz display.

Sometimes sensing issues at the curved sides. Rest all fine. Current scheme of hdfc instant discount will help you get 6 gb model for 38k and 8 gb for 40k. I would recommend you to go for 8 gb for 2k extra however I had bought 6gb version but now I think 8gb , 256gb storage would have been better. Ram of 6 gb is not an issue but 256gb storage is a big advantage over 128gb. Hope it helps in making your buying decision."

The 90HZ display is probably the best in any smartphone right now.The camera is much improved than the older versions , battery life is good and the performance is top notch as usual.
It still has a few cons though with not having wireless charging , a slightly sub par camera compared to the other higher end flagships and the lack of a pure ip rating.
But at this price point you simply can‚Äôt complain.I would say if you are looking for the best bang for your buck smartphone this is the one you should go with without a doubt.."

OnePlus 7 Pro,1,"Worst battery back up, Pathetic service from Amazon","The battery back up on the so called 4000 mAh is only 7 hours. This 7 hours is with just 20 minutes screen usage.
Raised a replacement request with Amazon. The technician who was supposed to visit on the scheduled day called up and mentioned that battery issue can come up because of apps and also the screen resolution. I have been using one plus 5t and it lasted 20-25 hours with the same usage and same applications. I had to put all my applications in optimise in the 7 pro to keep the battery last till evening. My friends using one plus 7 (not the pro) did not face any issue and their batteries lasted for over 20 hours.
The worst part on Amazon's side is that the technician did not turn up and I got an email saying I was not reachable. When I contacted the technician he mentioned that he was busy with other customers and so he turned down my req. Now Amazon calls me back the next day from some unknown number and asks me for my details to place this technician request.
Why playing cheap tactics to avoid replacement amazon by extending the dates ?"

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,One of the best phones you could ever buy,"One of the best phone i have ever bought. In fact i have been a fan of Oneplus since 3 years. My first phone from Oneplus was Oneplus 3 which is still performing amazing though it has been 3 years. Good thing about Oneplus 7 pro is it has got everything you need unlike the other phones which is cheap but comes with bloatware, which literally sucks. My rates are below.
Camera - 9/10
Speed - 10/10
Sound - 10/10
Resolution - 10/10
Fingerprint and Face recognize - 10/10
Over all - 10/10
Also, the best part is i bought it when there was better offer available from Amazon, which was like 12,000. On top of this i spent about 1,500 for the screen protection which keeps it safe from the damage. Protection Pro which is made from rubber material mostly used by 3M works really well on your phones.
Overall i am happy customer of amazon as well as OnePlus."

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,BEST PHONE UNDER 50K,"I have been using this phone for more than a month now and here is my short review-
Camera- Camera is extremely good until you bring s10 or iphone11 into competition....other than that it easily beats other phones falling below 50k line
Software and Speed- NO MATCH.....This is THE most fluid and comfortable experience i had using a phone ever....i dont think any phone can match this level of smoothness
Battery- Sort of Average i would say but Warp Charging is Extremely Fast and hence it makes the overall experience good
Display- NO MATCH....No Bezels, No Notch, No Punch-hole....Just Pure Screen....That Curved 2k 90hz display is the best screen i have ever used and even better than my friend's Note 10 Plus
Audio- Dual Stereo Speakers Is Super loud and Crisp and gives a very enhanced music experience
But i regret buying the oneplus bullets 2 as it sounds like budget bluetooth earphones
I also have attached some pictures...i would recommened to buy Nebula Blue as it looks different from the crowd
Thanks for reading"
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,One plys 7pro,Average
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Excellent,Excellent
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Smooth Display,Very Good Product
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Worth to buy at 43k,Good flagship phone... But I personally don't like oxygen UI . It provides only limited user-friendly software.
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,superb camera quality,iam happy with the phone but initially it did not work properly(cracking voice) with Vodafone sim so I had to port my number to JIo.
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Great Phone,"One of the best phone in the market currently.
I got this 8 GB RAM+256GB @Rs 39000 during decent sale period which includes 2k HDFC instant discount+ 1.7k HDFC loyalty cashback+6k One plus 5th year anniversary discount.
So for me it was a gorgeous deal.
Everything seems to be great apart from battery which was a tad disappointing but then u have got a 30W super quick charger."
OnePlus 7 Pro,3,Okay,Price high
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Good product,Very nice
OnePlus 7 Pro,3,Overpriced..,Display is good but we don‚Äôt spend 40k + on a phone that is just look good in your hand..
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Ok but not the best.,Not having good camera.
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Oneplus7pro,"I have waited for a very long time and finally i have it in my hands...
Stunning design
Gorgeous display
Incredible performance"
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,worth the price,Best phone for its price. Phone is superfast. Camera quality is awesome. Battery life is great. Display is amazing. Only thing that OnePlus should do is providing good quality screen guard / glass.
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,very good,very good

OnePlus 7 Pro,2,Used and Battry life sucks,"I got the handset on time but after use battry life is very low as we know flagship phone..i think device is already used before and handed over to ke from the dealer.
Amazon need to work on this why dealer sending bad things in 50k .
You need to send well varified product and all."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Buttery Smooth,"Switching over to Oneplus is a heartwarming experience for me, although i am writing this as my first post but trust me this is most suitable premium phone with bundle of features and Oxygen OS is just awesome.

OnePlus 7 Pro,4,"Two months after using the phone, the most shocking thing was...","Firstly, a great phone, all the features which it has right from the notchless display to the 90Hz refresh rate coupled with the space and the UFS 3.0 transmission, this device works buttery smooth
With the android 10 update now availale, the phone has only improved system and UI experience wise with dark mode and the addition of digital well-being.
Though a bit overpriced than Redmi K20 pro, i feel if you really want a great UI experience with the Oxygen OS and dont mind spending a little more for a phone, this phone will serve you atleast 3-4 years making it value for money"
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Amazing Device,"Phone is just amazing...every time i unlock it i just fell in love with the beautiful display...Super fast processing, design is quite good, speakers on this device give a totally different experience while watching movies and playing games.
Little dowsides of the device includes-1)Camera:- I am not saying its bad,its above average but one plus could have used a better camera setup just to match this phones other flagship features.
2) Battery life: battery% goes a lill fast but can be overcome  with its 30 watts warp charger which is so fast that in just couple of minutes it gets hours of power to manage the tasks.
Overall my experience with this phone till date is quite amazing."

Screen quality is good but not in par with Samsung's, 90 Hz screen is a delight to use. Camera also not in par with Samsung and Apple but at this price point we can't complain.

OnePlus 7 Pro,3,NICE DEVICE BUT STILL NEED SOME IMPROVEMENT,"I am using this device from last 2 months and it's seems good time to right my personal opinion about this device.
Display is osm no doubt about it, and phone feel very premium in hand, but it's very slippery so impossible to use without Case.
Battery charging speed is osm but battery backup is not that impressive. I am a normal user just check my email and business messages and youtube nothing else.
I bought this device around 44k and now price drop to 39999 in 2 months.
THE BIGGEST ISSUE WHICH I AM FACING WITH THIS DEVIVE IS THAT IT SUDNELY STOP WORKING AND THEN WORK FINE AFTER 2 OR 3 MINUTE LATER. I AM NOT SURE ABOUT THIS ISSUE WHY SO MANY OTHER USER ARE GETTING THIS AS WELL.
Hope this review will be helpfull for other buys are well."

Phone has started lagging behind for most of the apps and activity after a month of usage...On this pricing segment it hurts with the current performance."
OnePlus 7 Pro,1,RECIEVED A PHONE WITH DEFECTIVE SCREEN,"DISAPPOINTED !!!
This purchase was a surprise disappointment ! This is my 3rd 1plus buy... Have always loved their phones .
This time around , I have recieved my OnePlus 7pro phone with a sort of notch on the side of the phone ,below the on- off button . Initially looked like a part of the bezel , but then I realised that the pixels were not working in the area . The black bezel like spot also has a voilet hallo around it . Haven't used the phone much to comment on the battery life, camera quality is decent . Fingerprint reader is not the best...
OnePlus team and Amazon team have been cooperative so far..
Have already enlisted for a replacement."

But still it will amaze you. Battery backup is quite good. I won't say excellent. But, even after my rough use, it has some charge left at the day. And, I am kind of heavy user. I will be using Whatsapp, Facebook, Twitter and all, so I use pretty good amount of that screen. But, it's still left with some juice at the end of the day."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,"90Hz Display , Superfast charging what else you need in 40K","Can't go back to a phone with an 60 hz display after using this one for a couple of months it's an steal deal for 40K , display is awesome and camera's are fine not bad not too good but charging speed is so good that it can beat any phone , was confused between iphone 11 and op 7 but I am glad that I saved my 20k and also got an better phone"

I had been using OnePlus 5 before this and that was what made me a fan of that company. Seamless experience with a superb camera. Helped me a lot on my trip to the US. Check out a few shots."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Depends on what you want,A great mobile for those who wanted to read articles or gaming .Good mobile for those who want a quick responsive mobile.Not recommend for those who wanted to use light weighted and wanted to use only text and calling purpose .

It is one of worst phone..they have priced at premium phone. But it's nowhere premium phone ..i feel it upgrade version of MI phones..not sure what this gimic is. Qhd 90hz refresh rate..all nonsense. Camera is biggest let down..with no waterproof certification and wireless charging..i regret i hav seen all this before..now i want get rid of this phone..i want to sell ..used only 1month..it's a cheap phone with highly priced."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,camera,working fine
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,My faver nice smart phone,Better mobile phone one Plus 7pro verrey nice
OnePlus 7 Pro,1,price,everything is nice but what about the price who bought the phone for 53k now you are giving the mobile for 43k what is this amazon we are getting so much of loss while buying mobiles u are giving 10k discount on mobile not at all goodüò°üò° so thats y my review is 1 star
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Printer cantina,Not getting print this mobile
OnePlus 7 Pro,3,It's not the same OnePlus it used to be,"Oneplus used to be a company which always maintained it's product's value, I hardly experienced price drop on my oneplus 3. Now there is a massive drop of 12000/- just within 6 months. I'm very disappointed with this."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Good Buy or Deal from Amazon,Experience of Oxygen OS and Powerful Build is unmatchable
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,I'm loving it..,"This is a review after a month usage:
Pros:
Display- 5+/5
Camera 4.5/5
Touch-4.7/5
Battery-4/5
Fast changing- 5+/5üòú
Fingerprint sensor: 5
Now coming to the in-depth review, first thing was the Display: Which I noticed when I opened the package and switched on the phone was the built in wallpaper animation and that's when I immediately noticed the 90 hz fluid AMOLED display's awesomeness üòçüòç. Then the next time was while playing pubg, it's graphics was simply awesomeüòç. Then again the third time I fell in love was during the display setting when we can manually tune the display colours. And I really longed for a curved edge display phone for a long time and all these features put together felt awesome.
Camera: At first, I was very sceptic about it as there were bad reviews swarming around cameraüòÖ. Then immediately the phone was demanding me to update it which I eventually did , which was around 2 gb. And then I took a few picture in artificial lighting with fingers crossed but it was fine. Then post that I thought the camera was not up to the marküòµ. But to my surprise it was me who was the culprit üòú and this came to light when I took some pictures during daylight, also I'm new to the triple camera setup so I was the one to be blamed for and not the phone, then as I got a hold of it the, picture quality was getting better and better üòç. So now I can say it has a pretty decent quality üòâ though it's not in comparison with other flagships out there I'm really happy with it's images also the 3x zoom feature will shock you as there is no loss in the image quality. Portrait mode is awesome but you will have to get used to it, selfie camera is also awesome, which also gives you awesome images üòç.
Gaming: I'm not s hard core gamer at least in Mobile , since this device has pretty hardware built for games I thought of giving it a try, and to my surprise I fell for it at the login screen as the animations were so pleasing to the eyes üòç and during the game play there was no frame drops and the gameplay was pretty smooth üëç
Battery: since it's a heavy 4k mAh battery I thought it would last for a more than a day on heavy usage, but it's not so coz of increased resolution and refresh rate, it drains the battery a lot especially during heavy usage, but if we are not using it much the battery easily lasts for 1.5 days, plus the Warp charging, just shatters your perspective about charging, coz it charges three device  from 10-100 in shy of 80 mins which is mind blowing.
Finger print scanner is one of the plus for this device coz it's blazingly fast when compared to it's competitors üëçüòç
Oxygen Os: I'm a first time user and to me this interface is just as smooth as butter, the feel, the response,90hz refresh rate, vibrant Display all together is simply awesome. No lags so far. Will update this in coming months.
Only con was the ear phone jack , but that can be resolved using a USB c to 3.5 converters , I used ptron adapter which is amazing and you can also charge and connect to earphones at the same time üòÖ.
I guess that's it for now will update on near future, if you're planning to buy this you can blindly go for it and won't regret üëç"
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Worthy.....,The device is Very nice and it doesn't disappoint you

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Superb,"Superb ,No words....."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Awesome phone go for it,Awesome phone go for it
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,All about good,"Display, lock system, nd also camera"
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Great,It's good
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,A great machine with intelligent mind,I like everything about it from body to finish and camera. All are top class.
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Feel the greatness,"amazing mobile with a stunning display, gorgeous design, good cameras but selfie cam could've been better. I have bought it for no cost emi. The package was really good, Thank you amazon."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Why the 7T pro is worth buying!!,"The OnePlus 7T Pro is very much similar to the OnePlus 7 Pro, having only a couple of changes. You get an upgraded processor as well as a slightly bigger battery with improved fast charging. So, if you‚Äôre confused between the OnePlus 7T and 7 Pro, you should see the changes, that will not matter much in day to day usage and you can save yourself some money. But for those looking for a 8GB/256GB model, the 7T Pro would be a great device."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Almost perfect 4.5/5,Does almost all the things perfectly. One of the best buys I did in the recent times. Absolutely crushes all the other phones when it comes to performance and speed.

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Good condition,Nice super
OnePlus 7 Pro,1,GO FOR SAMSUNG OR IPHONE,Overall not good experience
OnePlus 7 Pro,2,Nothing more than a piece of stunning display,"**[Review updated on 03-01-2020]
Pros:
1. Stunning QHD+ display with fluid 90Hz refresh rate.
2. Earpiece sound is loud & clear.
3. Slow motion video recording is really nice.
4. Front camera perform quite well.
5. Wrap charging tech is really good, it hardly takes  a hour or less to charge it from 0-100%.
Cons:
1. Battery backup is still below average, though the recent OTA updates really helps lower the battery consumption when the phone is in idle mode.
2.Rear Camera performance is average (was mediocre but the recent updates brings some noticable improvements), in outdoor good lighting conditions it performs really good,low light shots looks good anything else is just average. 48MP camera is nothing more than a gimmick if you not into RAW images or editing kind of stuff, camera settings has very few options to play with, Nothing interesting or exciting. like 3D emoji etc.
3.Night Mode and reading mode are not effective at all, both of these has a huge scope of improvements(Still the same), the experimental DC dimming feature is not upto the mark.
4.Sometimes it hangs while using instagram, Facebook, YouTube, chrome (SD855 was one of the best SoC.. ü§îOh really???)
5. Not an issue anymore (There's a very weird issue with the front camera, sometimes it automatically get opened while switching between apps especially WhatsApp.)
[UPDATE]
OnePlus targeted the RAM management issue through an OTA update but the issue is still the same(no doubt there's slight improvement)
(Worst RAM management I ever seen in this segment. I hardly installed 14-15 apps out of which 5-6 are being used frequently still the 75-82% of RAM is always in use, I use Avast app to do so, still the issue is same.
While writing this review using Amazon App, every time I switch to gmail or WhatsApp, I need to re-navigate to this review page again & again and start writing the review from the very first line
Note: Right now there is no app in recent app sectiom other than Amazon.)
What I want to suggest you guys don't go for it if you're not a OnePlus fan. There is nothing good about it other than this stunning display."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Top of the line performance,"What can i say
#Amazon delivered it within 8 hours of ordering
But after almost a month i see a huge price drop which is a heartbreak as i could've got the 12gb model at the price for which i got 8 gb.
But coming to the phone it's an absolute beauty.
The display is crazyyyyyy i mean after using 90 hz of a monster amoled with absolutely no notch is just mesmerizing. It's very hard to use any other display after using this. Top of the line.
I'm not much of a camera person but still the cameras are pretty good for above average requirements. Maybe some software tweaks can enhance the image processing.
And the warp charging is a lifesaver. Though after Android 10 update the charging speeds have dipped quite a bit. I hope OnePlus comes with an update for fixing the charging speed. Else the battery life is above average.
Sound quality through speakers is amazing.
And the flagship processor makes sure the performance is butter smooth.
And it hardly heats up. Even after heavy gaming.
An average frontline round of Call of Duty consumes only 2% battery at full settings which is amazing.
I hope wireless charging was offered too it would've been a huge plus.
But conclusion is it's an amazing phone.
And hey I've switched from Apple to OnePlus after using it for 4 straight years.
I never imagined that android ui could be so good so close to iOS response.
Hats off #OnePlus you rock but please solve the charging speed issue."
OnePlus 7 Pro,2,Unreliable company,They keep on decreasing the price of their phones and the after market value becomes low so dnt buy oneplus. OnePlus started as a budget smartphone maker and it will remain the same.
OnePlus 7 Pro,2,Chuti,Very very bad battery and camera
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,No words ü•∞,Good
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Beast mobile,"As I expected from one plus.It is a beast a flagship killer‚ù§Ô∏è
But battery life is very poor.
Hate the battery life.
One plus please do something about it."
OnePlus 7 Pro,3,Not sattisfied.,Overhyped phone. Only having good in specs doesn't make a phone good. It is also about software running phone. I had samsung galaxy s7 which was awesome phone and after reading reviews bought this phone instead of samsung note 10. Its all regret after that. App will refuse to open up many times. Fingerprint sensor will not work seamlessly if angle change slightly. Overall user experience is not like high end mobile.
OnePlus 7 Pro,1,Awesome mobile but is problems is missing item,Phone is very awesome but some item missing in the boxes i am not happy

OnePlus 7 Pro,4,It is good quality mobile.,"I am satisfied with the overall usability, function and quality speed of mobile. Camera feature is superb."
OnePlus 7 Pro,2,OnePlus 7pro disappointed me...,Before purchasing OnePlus 7pro..asked my friend about OnePlus they has given good review for one plus...now i bought OnePlus 7pro camera quality is good but my mobile is hanging a lot while checking photos on gallery suddenly it will come out from the gallery and phone wallpaper get changed like default wallpaper will appear..while using insta or watsup not able to share pics it's taking too much time to loading..one plus disappointed me a lot..i am thinking why i bought this mobile i spent 50k on this phone instead i hv to purchase iphone.. if is there any chance to return i will definitely return this phone...
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Go for it if you want a great display experience and a performance beast !!,"Fallen in love with it's display !! OnePlus made such a great device ... Thank you so much OnePlus
Though i had some issues with Amazon. They sent me defective unit twice and both the times there was a problem in that pop up camera , it was making weird sounds while poping up"

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Awesome phone experience after switching on one plus 7 pro,Awesome experience first time i switch on one plus i am fully fully satisfied worth for money :)
OnePlus 7 Pro,2,Is it worth to spend on phone with similar price compare to iphone?,"The answer is big no. I am not delighted with performance of the phone.
Finger lock is not sensitive. Requires two three times pressing.
It started hanging now (after use of 2-3 months). Auto brightness doesn't work at all.
Sometimes calls come but screen remains black :).
Camera is good. But spending 45k for camera only with these problems, is it realy worth?
Big disappointment that i can not throw it away :("
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Awesome,Awesome
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Superb,Good
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Loved the experience,At 90hz refresh rate the battery drains but the experience is a lot better as compared to 60hz. But you can change it to 60hz as per your convenience. Altogether the best smartphone in the market right now

Screen quality is awesome and use without case the phone give a classy look in your hand so I recommend use without case but lot of care because phone is too slippery.

I request you all(whoever brought this phone) to Keep your phone safely inside your bag.
Damn, I was soon careless, my dad is never going to buy me such a costly phone from now on."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,A Beast but unrecognised,"I'm really satisfied with the phone but only grief is that just after the success of OnePlus 7T, company launched OnePlus 7T Pro which just has only spec bump i.e., 855+ and nothing else. And just for this, they have totally forgotten this phone. Both phones i.e., OnePlus 7 Pro and 7T Pro have same specifications but still they take a long time to give minor updates and security patch. Just for the purpose of Introducing a new model half yearly, they have forgotten the phone they JUST launched. Really unhappy with what the company has done."

Else will have to switch over to other brands."

OnePlus 7 Pro,1,The worst experience ever!,The worst experience. You can't play heavy games like PUBG and COD and even use Youtube for a long time because there comes over heating! They say there is a cooler inside.. But. I don't feel so. Screen keeps freezing while I play games due to this heating problem. Other apps keep closing automatically! I couldn't even share pics via WhatsApp cuz it started to load the pic forever! Still my hands are heating.. Never ever buy this crap.. go for a Samsung seriously.

I am getting irritated when I am try to make a call. I need to wait for 30 to 40 seconds in that to most of the time it closing automatically showing phone is not responding. I didn't expect this from one plus. Totally waste product...Maine one plus esse pahle 2and 3t use Kiya but ye bakwas he

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Long review after using for 2 months,"Let me begin by saying that the display is just amazing. Everything is buttery smooth and fast. Coming to the fingerprint scanner it could be better because sometimes it takes time to read. Face id is fast, although i have nothing else to compare it with but still good. And camera to be honest is actually good and night mode is little bit sumdgy somtimes but still captures good night pictures. Video recording is the best i gotta say, it is very stable. The only problem i found about the video is the 4k 60 fps mode, the file size is so large it is actually impossible to record more than 10 mins which would probably take about 10gb of memory. The front camera is also pretty decent. Coming to the os its one of the best i have used and all the apps function very very smoothly. If you are planning to go for iphone in the same range i would recommend to go for oneplus 7 pro since its a much better buy."

OnePlus 7 Pro,4,OnePlus is good,Battery drains faster
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Very,Very nice mobile
OnePlus 7 Pro,3,Best but not a beast.,"I buy this phone for it's curved & full view display but there is other department also which should be considered.
‚Ä¢Okay,battery life is average,not long lasting as mi or realme 3 smartphone (reason is 6.67 inch large & amoled display).
‚Ä¢Run high graphic games smoothly with some heating but getting heated if you play pubg at ultra hd & extreme frame rates.
‚Ä¢well camera pictures quality is average,not like in youtube videos sample but this should be okey because other than youtuber videos sample there is not so much difference b/wsamsung,oneplus,oppo,apple camera,
But 4k video & normal video recording is very good.
‚Ä¢Important thing is it's oxygen os - it is good but not a hyped which many youtuber spread & there is no inovation in it.
‚Ä¢Other cons is its lacking(absence) of inbult app locker because you can apply a password with screen lock but also use same password to lock your app which is not good for privacy point of view..
So, this is my conclusion after using this for around one month.

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,A flagship killer indeed!!,"Simply a worthy premium smartphone for daily use. Have been using it for almost 4+ months. 90Hz display is amazing and smooth (one of my favourite these days). On screen fingerprint is fast enough for unlocking the phone. Unfortunately, i didn't used face unlock and i didn't use front camera often. So no comments on that.
With 30W Warp Charge, the 4000mAh battery can be recharged pretty fast as well (as per the company's claim and its working excellent so far).
Camera is working as expected and also tried few nightmode shots and it is also satisfying.
No troublesome heating issues found so far.
There is no headphone jack, but i don't have any problem with that as I am using OnePlus Bullet Wireless 2 (Excellent choice for OnePlus7Pro).
Ps:- This is my first OnePlus company's product and I simply loved everything about it."

OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Best among all but please look at the problem I had mentioned.,After the update of android 10 and oxygen od it's lagging some times and mostly it happens with the whatsapp.
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Best OnePlus ever,"I have used OnePlus 2 in the past, I like the near stock android  experience with the oxygen OS. The speed of carrying any task is the main attraction of this device.
Though the camera is average , it actually takes good shots at times.
If you are looking for that curved screens like samsung, this is a wonderful phone, but with more of accidental touches on the edges while viewing content.
Charging speed is very helpful at all times."

OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Display marvel,"After a week use.
Pros:
Display is by far the best and awesome.
Fast response, UI is very smooth - 90 htz.
Camera is very good, not as good as Samsung and latest iPhones.
Battery backup is decent.
Cons:
Phone is very slippery.
No earphone jack, need to buy type-C earphone or adapter.
I could not set different SMS ringtone for dual SIMs.
No SD card slot.
I felt battery is draining faster and warp charger is slower than Vivo Nex.
Given transparent back cover is slippery. No additional matte cover as seen in unboxing on various YouTube videos.
Will post more as I find more.
____________________
Further experience:
Touch is not consistently responsive, especially through screen guard.
I had to buy type-C earphone and adapter for 3.5mm earphone, recording is not good through adapter.
48mp camera clarity can only be achieved in Pro mode, other modes are surprisingly of average or low standard compared to Samsung phones.
Noticed that GPS loses direction which is quite annoying and not sure others faced. I could compare with other phone on the same route.
Fingerprint response is incredible, top in Android phones.
WARP charging is faster than I noticed initially."

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Beautiful phone,Nyc
OnePlus 7 Pro,3,3.5 out of 5,"The phone could have been little handy, it's too big to handle. Now a days phone should fit your hand and it should be compact. We can buy a TV if we want a big screen.

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Near perfect smartphone,Overall great smartphone if available in price range of 40 - 43k. Oneplus could have provided 3.5 jack converter atleast. 90Hz display is worth it. Buy it and it's going to spoil you since you might not want to switch to standard 60 Hz display there after.

OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Amazing Phone,"Phone hardware and experience is very good, Phone is bit heavy then peers. No 3.5MM Jack given in box and recently updated OS10.0.1 have multiple bugs ( adaptive brightness and small issues). 7 Pro is better bargain if we see 7T Pro pricing. Two Dolby speakers are worth it, Picture quality is very good , 516 Ppi is equal to samsung 10+, Touch is super responsive. On the top of it OnePlus giving 2 year warranty through OnePlus Care App. Hence if your budget is around 40 K then this is super phone. 90Hz is also good."

OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Definitely go for it,"No headphone jack in box where it was available with 6T model and also no headphone/earphone in box after paying 48999 u can atleast expect a pair of headphone.the phone is also a little heavy
Apart from this everything is good the screen is as smooth as butter and the size is of 6.67 inch with 2k display and dual stereo speakers providing a truly cinematic experience.
Fastest processor SD855 and 4000mah battery gives you the best experience for gaming.
And you can also check how much you have spent on a particular app(digital wellbeing) and set timers for the app which is pretty cool
Camera is also good
Overall I would say definitely go for it and the colour nebula blue is amazing"

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Best flagship phone for now : Beauty and the Beast,"Super terrific phone. The display is out of the world. Buttery smooth touch due to the 90hz display refresh rate. Oxygen OS is simply the best and does not have any glitches. Recently got the Android 10 update also which is having much more features.
Ther is no lag experienced while playing games requiring high performance and graphics. Fanatic mode is an added advantage for this.
Coming to the battery department, I am able to use my phone for one and half days in a single charge. Icing on the cake is the 30W warp charger which charges from 0 to 70% battery in just 30 mins.
Only con is in the camera department and that too it's not very bad, but not up to the expectation from a flagship phone. Particularly the selfie camera.
Overall very much happy and impressed with this phone. Thank you OnePlus üôÇ"

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Amazing phone.,"This is a phenomenal phone especially considering what you pay. The screen is just spectacular with 90Hz display. The curved screen gives rise to more accidental touches than i like, but that's not a deal breaker. The factory fitter screen protector has started to chip and peel at places. But then again, i am using the phone almost all the time.
The blue colour is mesmerizing. Especially because it is matte. Always keep it in a case, as I am absolutely sure it can't take a fall."

I first ordered this and fingerprint reader came with defect after which I followed with amazon badly but got poor response. The phone was replaced in close to 7 days of time, the second phone also came with defect and it is heating up even over 45 degree while in normal usage and now it is a pain. Moreover amazon have very bad support on this. Polishing used on phone is also bad, after 10 days of normal usage scatches have appeared on phone not on glass back but on metal side of phone."

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Major issues i face,"Im finding issues with fingerprint reader. It is not much accurate it takes time to read my fingerprints
And battery backup is good i use to get my college done with a lite usage. If I had to go hard on my device during college I scale down to 60Hz and i could get a great backup. Overall it is a value for money"

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,WHATTA PHONE,Make no mistake just go for it if you can afford it. And now when 7t pro is around the corner you can still buy it and can avail discounted price.

OnePlus 7 Pro,4,"Good, but not great","Fingerprint reader is not that great. Sometimes if doesn't recognise. Far unlock is great, which is why I'm still okay to continue using this.
Camera quality is more than amazing during day. Taking 4k videos with 60fps is a treat to eyes. But evening photography is very bad. Every photo i take captures a lot of noise.
Battery life is amazing. I get a battery life from 100% to 0 for2 days."

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Overpriced,Over priced
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Worth buying under 40K after including exchange and other offers.,"I am not a big fan of Oneplus and always had a feeling of overpriced but when this product price reduce to 45k and had many offers, Immediately I booked and got this phone for 38k after applying offers.
Thanks to Amazon.
Camera and others features looks promising but again display seems above average not the best compared to samsung.
I feel this is the best phone to purchase under 40K."
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Worth the deal from OnePlus & Useless shipping by Amazon,"Been almost 4 months upgrading to the pro version of OnePlus , camera could have been better ,missed out on the most important feature the phone not being IP rated. Even than lots of reviewer have tested in water so did I & product seems to work fine without any issues .
Despite of having such a beautiful display & 90hrz power pack performance there isn't any tempered glass for same which I can protect it with .
Upgrades & updates have been consistently improving without any delay or lags.
Pop up camera seems to work perfectly great knowing the fact about limited numbers of move ,insipite of same there have been lot of safety measures for force movement incase occured at time in pocket . I wouldn't suggest to use face unlock more often as the under display scanner is the best in it's class & most freakingly smooth.
Glass back is litle bit scary at times as now we have to protect the front as well back of the phone ,for which I use the default case provided by OnePlus themself .
Shipping this phone has been a night Mayer for me as amazon weren't efficient enough to deliver the product to me on time ,as sum issue with there shipper & loss of good .which was a surprise to go through .
Overall it's a good experience on the handset side ,since there's nothing better than having a 90hz refresh rate & such a powerful performance."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Best one,One Fingerprint for both thumb is little slow.
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,One plus 7pro üòòüòòüòòüòòüòò,"Gooooood  camera quality
Best phone one plus 7pro"
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,A little expensive but worthy powerhouse,"Let's get the cons out of the way. I noticed mainly 3 things that may concern buyers.
1. Form Factor- The size and weight of this phone is too big. Even if I have bigger hands.its impossible to use in one hand. You will get used to the weight but when u pick up other devices u will feel OnePlus 7 pro could have better weight balamce. It may pain a little if u are lying down and watching any video for a long time.
2. Battery life - on paper 4000 mAh battery looks good.but it's battery back up is average. I am getting little more than  4 Hrs screen on time. U can increase the battery by turning off 90 hz . Buts what's the point of turning it off while 90 hz is the reason u r buying this phone.
3. No always on display- Coming from Samsung phones I really miss the always on display features. Thought it has ambient display but u can never see notification unless u touch the phone. Don't know why OnePlus did not give this feature. At least give a option to turn it on or off.
Now let's talk about advantages of this phone.
1. Display- oh boy.u can enjoy this beauty of display all day long. Quad Hd 90 HZ amodled display is stunning. Once u use 90 hz other phones will feel slow and that includes iPhone too.yeah u heard that right.
2. Sofwtwere experience- oxygen Os is so close to stock Android and in some cases it it better. Buttery smooth animation and super quick Android updates makes it one of the few devices having Android 10 at the time I am writing this review
3. Sound Quality- This phone does have a decent dual stereo speaker which gets very loud. Audio quality is great also has Dolby Atmos support.
4. Haptic feedback - I did not think earlier vibration  motors are to be considered as an advantages. But this phones vibration feedback is precise and strong. U will feel joy typing on this phone for sure.
5. I was sceptical about this phones camera because many reviewers said camera is the weakest point of this phone. But I found the main 48 mp sensor as good as S10, iPhone 11 level. Though it's secondary cameras lacks behind those flagships.  U can tweak the photos little bit and will get excellent result. One plus nighscapeobe is brilliant. Better than Samsung's night mode.
6. Performance - Snapdragon 855 and adreno 640 is more than capable of heavy tasks and gaming and this phone is no exception. Never faced any lag. That's it.
Verdict- The pros overweights the cons by very long margin. If u can manage the weight or size this phone will bring a smile on your face. Thanks."

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Never settle,Go beyond speed
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Spectacular,"I cant tell you how amazing this phone is! I have been using this phone since one month.
I would just say, go for this phone and you will never regret buying this!
My mind was flipping between k20 pro and oneplus 7 pro, review in various websites says that both the phones are almost same in every aspect except the range,my sister bought k20 and i got a chance to test the camera on both the phones with my own naked eyes, and what i found is the quality of pictures on oneplus 7 pro is something i have never ever seen on any smartphone, not even iphones.
Apart from the amazing camera, there are alot other features that i wished to be present in my phone. The gestures work perfectly, touch works as smooth as butter.
No phone heating even while playing games in highest quality graphics. Yes, it heats little bit when you play and charge ur phone at the same time, but that is acceptable as it does not happen in every scenario and little bit is fine considering the processor.
If you have proper knowledge of how to capture a photo by setting uo the focus and other stuffs, trust me you will end up taking a photo just like a dslr camera.
Haptic feedback is another amazing feature on this phone, it really takes the gaming to another level, it vibrates when there is a beat/bass in the sound effect, wow so amazing man!
Dolby speakers is another legendary feature that will blow your mind! Two speakers are always better than one!
The flexibility to change the screen resolution just like in pcs is another feature. If you are worried that 90hz refresh rate would consume more battery, oneplus proved it wrong! I have not noticed any unnecessary battery consumption by the screen! The android version 10 has given this phone amazing utilization of resources, intellegent analysis by android tells me if any website or app is consuming battery higher than expected, this is a much needed feature on a smartphone with tons of apps loaded in it just like mine.
To be really very frank, i have used this phone vigorously since i bought it just to check the benchmark of this phone and has not yet disappointed me. The only cool stuff from oneplus i miss on this phone is the notification led, coz there is no hardware support for it, although oneplus has tried to use the screen as the notification led, but it needs improvement and development and i am expecting oneplus team to arrange something cooler for the led.
I am fully satisfied with this phone and i am hoping oneplus would not discontinue this product or pushing the android upgrades else it would be a huge disappointment.
Great job Oneplus team!"
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,#Awesome product #Great job OnePlus,"Awesome product ...again One plus shows it's class and master peice of workmenship. Totally it feels great in hand...

Performance wise no doubt.
Need a improvement in camera most importantly on low light.
Night sight mode is good. But colors are varied.

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Battery life is not at all good,Battery is draining is faster...i need to claim warranty on battery..
OnePlus 7 Pro,1,This would be my last OnePlus phone.,"Not impressed at all with OnePlus 7 pro (12GB RAM) Other than night mode picture quality.
Cons
-- Phone heats up while playing the game and this not what I expected for a 12 GB RAM, RAM size is literally a waste of money.
-- Phone is bulky fat and heavy does not fit in all kind of pant pockets.
--  Battery life is worse than my previous OnePlus 5T I regret giving away my 5T for this.
Pros
Night mode pictures
Notch less full-size display.
My OnePlus 5T was a lot better than this I will not buy a OnePlus again better by a Samsung. or Huawei.  I believe this no much difference with OnePlus 7T either. I wanted to return it but the policy won't let me do that, not impressed Amazon, I regret not reading Amazon return policy before buying."

Purchased this at the time of launch and since then it has been an awesome gaming and video experience. Only thing is that they could have worked a little better on the night mode and on the quality of front camera. Apart from this no complaint, a truely awesome product."

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Beauty and beast,4 months and running like a champ!
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,A great purchase at a right price,"Got it for Rs 37k with exchange and oneplus+hdfc offer after the Diwali sale. An absolute steal at this price.
Pros:
1. Stunning looks in nebula blue colour. The black is fine but is a fingerprint magnet.
2. Full body 90hz curved display with punchy colours and deep blacks is an absolute joy to use
3. Snappy performance with fludic animations. 8 GB RAM and 256 GB Internal memory is more than enough for a moderate user.
4. Good enough camera for my needs (as I already own a DSLR)
5. Great battery backup if you turn on the dark theme and keep display resolution to auto and brightness upto 50%(somewhere around 7-8 hours of screen on time which is good for 2 days)
6. Marvelous audio quality with speakers and via headphones/earphones due to dolby atmos.
7. Liquid cooling which keeps the phone temperatures below 40 degrees at most times (the 7T lacks this and gets as hot as 46 degrees, compare online temperature tests)
Cons:
1. No headphone jack and no adapter provided
2. Originally priced at 53k, such a device should house a water resistance and dust proof IP rating"

This phone is poor in battery and attract scratch very eaisly.
Due to curves , it's not easy to apply tempered glass on phone and most of the shopkeepers struggle on this.
Overall expectations are not met.
Better you buy 1 plus 7t because 12 GB Ram is not actually active 12 GB Ram which we have tested."

In India we say ""Naach naa aawe aangan tedha"".
I am writing this after using 30 days my phone and I'm really impressed with its look, performance, camera and the best thing is update to oxygen 10 os. It's really the gift for the oneplus users. You'll love its features.

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,üòçüòç,Amazing product...i loved it
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,The best from OnePlus till date,"Been using the phone for more than a month now. Exceptional build quality, beautiful aesthetics and practically the best phone I've used. Everytime I take it my phone, people are amazed by it's full screen display and it's beautiful looks. Love the OnePlus brand."
OnePlus 7 Pro,1,Dissapointed: You don't enjoy the features of the phone when basic problems are arising..,"I purchased OnePlus 7pro one month back and it was running fine. Though the camera was not as per the expectation but still it's quality was fair
But after upgrading my device to Android10 it started hanging on occasions. The battery was draining fast. And recently it hanged for 20 mins while it's temperature was raising quickly. You don't expect this basic problems to arise when you buy a device worth 50k and that to from OnePlus."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Super,Super phone
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Charging Adapter & lead are not working properly,Charger is not working properly üò°
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Oneplus 7 pro Excellent phone,"The phone is Just Awesome.
1.The quality of display and audio is nice.
Curve display is very good looking.
2.phone is very smooth to operate.
3.Gaming performance graphics is very good.
4.There is no heating issue. But instantly cools down when gets warm.(warm means not high you think just little bit when you play games.)
5.pop up camera is no problem you can raise many times it not effect.
Note:-Overall very good phone in these price range. Don't believe any negative Comments."

OnePlus 7 Pro,3,Price is not met expectations.camera poor quality,Camera quality not better compare to iphone.overall Gaming performance and battery life was awesome.sometime phone hang.Price of this phone not met with expectations.if you are able to pay 50k don't buy add some money and buy iPhone or note 10.
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Best but you can make in 45k. Phone just don't performs awesome but feels very premium as well.,"The screen size and viewing has just spoiled me.
The bezeless screen with curved display is really to die for. I don't know if I can ever go back from this screen to any other device now.
The processing speed is really really good.
It doesn't slow down when it is dying in battery or if 4-5 apps are running in parallel. Processing is just flawless.
When I was buying this phone, I was continuously told that camera is something u won't like. However, to my surprise till now the images taken are just amazing.
Really love the portrait mode and wide angle feature on this. So amazing.
Overall mobile feels really premium in your hands.

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Best display phone,Good phone for the money
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Why did 1+ launch 7Tpro when 7Pro was good enough?,"Well, there is nothing to dislike about this device. I own the 8GB Ram version of OnePlus7Pro. But, OnePlus could‚Äôve delayed the launch of OnePlus7TPro. Within a couple of months, your phone is no longer the flagship even though the device was launched less that 3 months ago of my purchase.
Note:
1. Camera is above average but not among the flagships of other brands.
2. Display is amazing. I‚Äôve not experienced anything like it before.
3. Just received an update for Android 10.
4. OnePlus needs to reconsider gap between launching flagship devices."

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Dpaul,"Nice camera , good speed, good battery life.
Totally satisfied."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Summary,"Everything is great, the camera, dual speakers, battery life, especially 90Hz dazzling display, very smooth.
A new phone may show high battery drain, don't worry, that would be your phone learning the use of battery and optimizes accordingly. A little heavy than other phones but you'll get used to it.
After using 90Hz smoothness, other phones may not feel so good.

OnePlus 7 Pro,4,If you want to happy don't compare it with note 10+,"Before oneplus 7, we purchased note 10+ a week ago and in comparison between op7 and note10+, the clear title winner is note10+. There is no comparison between these two.. if one can spend 52 k he can also spend 60k. Just go for note 10+ and feel the difference"

OnePlus 7 Pro,1,Worst Purchase,"Please see the attached video. This was my first oneplus purchase. I purchased it on 20th Oct in sale and prepaid 42000. Got it on 24th and as you see it had faulty Android and hanging issue. I was unable to do even initial setup. NOW AMAZON REMOVED THEIR RETURN POLICY. so you can not directly return it, one TAPORI technician will come and he will check whether mobile is really having any issue or not. Trust me he was one of the most unprofessional person I met in my life. But some how he understood my problem and forwarded the issue to Amazon team. So now my replacement will come in next week.
CONCLUSION: I paid 42000 on 20th Oct and I got working mobile on 4th of Nov. This is worst service by Amazon and worst product of Oneplus. Never gone buy any oneplus product again."

Still waiting for the updated camera software which was promised by the OnePlus team during the launch of this phone. Battery life is better than average but not so good for heavy users.

OnePlus 7 Pro,4,SUPERB...,I am a big fan of OnePlus device. This was my 3rd phone from OnePlus.

OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Great looks. Decent stats. Overall good phone.,"Great phone. I wanted this phone to play pubg. It's buttery smooth! Love the haptic feedbacks, as of now it may only work for pubg. Battery life is not that good. But definitely not bad. The camera quality for a phone at this price range could have been better... Since this phone does not have 3.5 mm jack you can't charge and play. Either have to but the adapter or the One Plus Bullets. It's priced at 1,409/- which is definitely overpriced for it's slightly above average performance... I bought this phone for the display and the Snapdragon 855. If you don't mind the chin and notch you can definitely go for the Asus rog that's got better stats. But only if you're using it for gaming...."

And the given tpu case was very nice and protective too. All box contents are ok but if the type c to 3.5mm connector is they given means it would be nice. Bcas we have to purchase it by additional cost..
Pros:
Display quality qhd display
90hrtz refresh rate was nice
Finger print reader was better sometime lags
Warp charger do's it's work better
Network connectivity and voice clarity also nice
Android 10 after update battery is quite good
Cons
No type c to 3.1 connector
And I can't get normal temper glass for this model bcas it needed uv tempered glass it cost you min 700/-
Camera software could be updated
Bulky in hand bcas of 208gm weight

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,The fastest Android Smartphone in the Market,"Firstly I would like to say that this mobile is currently one of the fastest android smartphones in the market. Now let's go to the PROS and CONS of this device. This is my review after using it for one week.
PROS-
1) Beautiful and elegant design with Gorilla Glass 5.
2) Full-View Display with beautiful curved edges with 90Hz and 2K resolution with AMOLED Panel(on par with SAMSUNG).
3) The Camera performance has improved tremendously after the Android 10 update. I would rate it to be as same as Samsung Galaxy S10 and way better than the iPhone 11(not Pro & Max). The main shooter is a 48MP camera(Sony IMX586) with an aperture of F1.6, a sensor size of 1/2'. The telephoto camera is an 8MP with an optical zoom of 3X and an aperture of F2.4. Both these cameras have OIS+EIS and can record videos in 4K 60fps. The ultra-wide camera is a 16MP shooter with a FOV of 116 degrees and an aperture of F2.2. The primary camera has great low-light performance and Night Mode is just awesome. The selfie camera is a pop-up module and I find it to be really attractive.
4) Do I need to say anything about the performance? This one's a beast with the Snapdragon 855 chipset, 6GB RAM and 128GB UFS 3.0 storage.
5) You all have heard the name, right? Oxygen OS-the best version of stock Android that you can get. Snapdragon 855 and Oxygen OS- a marriage made in heaven. Blistering speeds, no lags or crashes till now(Make sure to perform a factory reset after upgrading from Android 9 to Android 10 otherwise you may encounter lags or crashes).
6) WARP Charging- this is one of the most useful features of OnePlus. WARP Charge ensures that the 4000mAh battery goes from 0-50% in just 30 minutes. I generally don't let my mobile go beyond 25% charge and WARP charge ensures that I can top my device from 25%-100% in just around 1 hour.
7) Stereo Speakers with DOLBY ATMOS- it gives depth to music and watching movies is a pleasure on this device.
8) In-display Fingerprint Scanner- this is one of the fastest in-display fingerprint scanner out there. It unlocks the device in less than a second.
Now coming to the CONS of this device-
1) No Notification LED- there is no physical notification LED on this device. So in case of missed events, you have to wake the device to see them.
2) Missing Software Features- Some software features are missing on this device. Always-ON-Display is not there. Come on OnePlus, you have a team of high skilled developers and since the device comes with an AMOLED panel, I find no reason to exclude this feature.
3) The pre-applied screen protector is of no use. It has bubbles and will automatically come off after 5-6 hours of usage. A good tempered glass and a good protector case is recommended. The provided case doesn't live up to the expectations and I highly doubt if it will protect the mobile in case of an accidental drop.
4) Phantom Touches- I know it's a software glitch but sometimes these phantom touches are really irritating. They have really decreased since the Android 10 update but occasionally I still get them. A software update should fix the issue.
5) Lack of MACRO Photography- This one is really a bummer. For some odd reason, OnePlus did not include a MACRO lens or a specialised motor in OnePlus 7 Pro like they did in OnePlus 7T Pro. As a result, you don't get a specialised MACRO Mode.
6) The telephone camera does not support video recording and nightscape. OnePlus should address this issue with a software update.
7) No headphones are provided. At this price point, a decent pair of headphones are seriously expected.
8) Pricing- I got this mobile during Amazon Great Indian festival for around 43k. I feel this price to be a bit on the higher side. 40k is perfect for this mobile.
So considering all the above points, I would rate it 4.5 and will recommend this mobile to someone who wants a fast and smooth Android experience without any bloatware and one of the best cameras available right now."

Nightsight could be a bit better but still it has come leaps and bounds since the 'dark ages' the battery life leaves more to be desired for but warp charge is the best thing to be adapted with in half an hour i can go from nay to gaming without thinking will the charge last or not....

One plus 7 pro has heating problem. It gets heated without even using it. Gets heated when on charge. Gets heated while paying game. Feels like it will brust.
I bought one plus 2 3 years back it has the heating problem so i sold that. Now when i bought one plus 7 pro again it has the same problem. Infact i have replaced my previous one plus seven pro and the one which i got and using now has the same problem of heating. You can't use it continuously as it gets heated so much. Charging is fast. Battery life is ok. Processing is fast. Camera is good. But what's the point of spending 49k if yiu cant use is properly. Thanks."

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Simply Fabulous phone........................,"Pro & Cons for One Plus 7Pro:-
Pros:
1. I am a great fan of One Plus and i have been using one plus5 from last 2 year so there is no question of phone getting lagging issue or anything like that, but when i received my One Plus 7Pro lagging word is simply unavailable in my dictionary.
2. About fingerprint scanner it is quiet good but just hopping to be little faster, (Personal opinion) may be it is because of on display scanner some micro seconds delayed would be there.
3. Popup camera is best in class, face recognition is simply awesome.
4. Battery backup is ok you get whole-day utilization time if you are a frequent user.
5. Last thing the built quality & design is simply awesome. One has to be only careful for accidentally dropping on backside & on display corners because of it curve display.
Cons:-
1. No headphone jack 3.5mm one has to buy c-type converter or c-type headphone.
2. Its very difficult to put tempered glass for curve screen mobiles i have tried twice perfect fitting is impossible."

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,"Awesome phone; quick; bigger display, long battery life. Amazon one-day delivery as promised","First have to give Amazon five stars for delivering this item on promised one-day delivery. Bought this phone as an replacement to my iPhone 6 (128 GB) & Coolpad note 3. My iPhone was draining battery in half a day; running basic call & messaging funcions slower.
OnePlus 7 pro is an worthy replacement. My cousin recommended it. She bought for 53,000 approx; I bought for 4,000 RS less. It's fast, has edge to edge bigger screen; dual SIM and very long battery life. It runs PUBG as smooth as silk. Most wonderful of all is ""Warp Charging"". This makes my experience, just awesome.
The latest update has changed cool airplane-mode animation (road appearing/disappearing). Loved that animation.
The item was out for delivery@3:34PM; called the delivery man but call didn't go through; twice. The delivery was attempted @5:40, when no one was home. Delivery man called; I told him to re-attempt any time, same day, anytime 45min-1 Hr later. That's when he insisted that I collect from neighbor; I wanted it to collect in person, so I refused. He told me he'll deliver the next day; I refused.
Through chat then in-app helpline call; was told delivery man was off duty. Then I gave an ultimatum that either the item be re- attempted or order be cancelled. Was ready to bid goodbye Amazon forever; deleting all saved cards, except the one for recovery of payment. Amazon personnel called back & resolved that deliveryman will re-attempt.
Amazon really treats it's customers like A King. Made my experience with them awesome. This close to decision to never buying anything from Amazon again; this close to Amazon loosing a loyal customer for life. My loyalty to this brand of online shopping, became stronger due to customer- delight attitude of Amazon.
Had bought a range of items from Amazon over the years; mostly electronics like headphones from leading brands like Sony, Bose, Sennheiser, etc phones like Coolpad note 3, iPhone 7, iPad 6th gen, Samsung M20, now OnePlus 7 pro. Love you Amazon. You are really A->Z (A through Z). This is the best online shopping experience ever."

1. Display is fantastic one of the best display I have seen ever
2. Camera is not that great but it gets job done
3. Battery is also on lower side as it's 90hz display consumes lot but as its charges quickly there won't be problem
4. As per my usage I would say oxygen os is better than stock in many ways as it have lot and lot of customization
5. It's a very minor thing - Haptic motor OMG it's just amazing you'll feel when you use it ..it's really super cool to experience while typing or navigating through gestures or receiving phone calls"

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Best android phone out there.,"The device looks gorgeous. This is really a premium device running Android and I would prefer this over Google pixel any day.
The cost of phone is low during sales and you get the best hardware in this price.
The processor is fast, camera is great and display is just mind blowing.
If you're coming from iPhone, this device will really impress you.
Any bugs that people here are facing are due to some software issues which are already fixed by oneplus.
Every phone has software issues (even iPhones).
And oneplus has been delivering software updates with great diligence. So no need to worry about outdated software.
The biggest pro is the display without any notch or punch hole.
But if you can go for iPhone 11 pro or pro max then go for the iPhone. Else this is the option to go for."

There is no option coming to unlock the screen.

And oxygen os good I was aching for this am really in love with the os... And more over I never wanna go back to apple again after coming to oneplus7 pro... I would strongly recommend this phone to any professional in this world.. didn't check out the camera am not a camera guy but it's decent not as bad as I thought... Thank you Amazon and OnePlus for making my purchase a worth one.. It's a good period to live with..üòç

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Great product,Everything is good about this product
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Ok,Product is OK but not stand as expected
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Awesome,Super speed processer.battery also good.sleek design
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Great overall package!,"Overall a very good package. I really like the Nebula Blue color. The phone is fast as is expected from OnePlus devices. Camera quality is decent (not at iPhone or Samsung level). It feels as if the sensor is slightly slower to capture images and this is especially evident in low light photography (not talking about Nightscape). I don't click too many pics so doesn't bother me all that much but might be important for someone else. Fingerprint is also a bit of a hit and miss. To improve its reliability, you can try to add the same finger twice (that's how I got around it).
90Hz screen, battery life and fast charging are a real asset. The phone is easily recommendable to people who are not buying a phone just for the camera."

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,One plus 7 pro,There is nothing to dislike in this..... Excellent smartphone
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,5,Good
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Great Phone with superb performance but an ok ok camera,"Overall a good mobile though the camera is not upto the mark as when we zoom into an image after clicking all of it gets mixed with the objects in the background. Though the nightscape mode and portrait mode of this phone is just great but normal camera does just a decent job. I was a big fan of OnePlus and was using OnePlus 3 before purchasing this and other than a little hardware update there is nothing much to this device. Also, its not worth the money (58k) just because of no IP rating and poor camera performance.
After using for about 3 months I can rate:-
Battery performance:- 4.5/5
Camera:- 3/5
Software:- 5/5
Display:- 5/5
Value for money:- 3.8/5."

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Best,It's Amazing phone in this time
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Great Device!,"Great Device! Amazing battery life, great camera quality and very smooth touch. Very impressive in display fingerprint sensor"
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,A Flagship with few shortcomings,"Oneplus 7 pro is a gorgeous device, looks great, feels great while in hand. Glass back with matte finish combined with curved glass adds a touch of premiumness to the phone. I have done some nitpicking although after thorough use of the device for 4 days.
1. Fingerprint reader is a tad bit slow sometimes. I have heard that it keeps on improving as days pass by. But it is annoying sometimes.
2. SOT is somewhat between 5-6 hours with normal usage,  it would have been good to have around 4500mah battery capacity.
3. Sensors does not work smoothly every time, auto brightness is aweful, fingerprint unlock misses one out of five times and pick up your phone to show has low response.
4. Phone is heavy, would require time to get adjusted.
5. Photo quality is great at daylights, but at night the corners get washed out a bit.
6. Horizon light feature is just laughable, it happens only for a single time once a notification pops up and not at a certain interval.
7. No 3.5mm headphone jack.
None of the google, samsung, apple or huwaei provides latest flagship below 50k price range, so if you can live with the cons mentioned above, then happily buy this device.
One more point, got the android 10 update on the same day I received the device from amazon. Thumbs up for oneplus support."
OnePlus 7 Pro,1,Don't Buy,Don't buy this phone. Lots of bugs in Gaming and Screen Recording App

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Very good,Wow nice one i have ever seen like this.
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Love it,It's a really powerful
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Longevity is a major win,"The phone is so good, I don't see myself upgrading to another phone in the next 4-5 years.
The design language of this phone is futuristic.
The pop-up front facing camera is James bond/Ethan hunt status.*(Not to worry about its durability)*
The battery life is sufficient even for general use
And lastly them specs üëçüëç
Look at the pictures for the camera quality and judge it for yourself. For me this camera will hold up for a long time.

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,I have Fallen in Love with This ‚ô•Ô∏è,"Excellent Device, my first impression with display is awesome, it has 2K 1440 panel Curves edge Display and its look so Great, and it is my first mobile to use 2K display. The 90hz Refresh rate is buttery smooth,and another important thing is OXYGEN OS, it is also main pro of this device its look close to Stock android, and feels better than stock android.
DESIGN:‚ò∫Ô∏è
It's feels very Premium, and also some Heavy, and is covered with gorilla Glass 5 protection, and it has pre applied screen protector. 9/10
PERFORMANCE:ü§©
Yes, We All Know It's with flagship Processor Snapdragon 855 Nothing to talk about it it Was AWSOME. 10/10
CAMERAS:üôÇ
Selfies are not much better but Good
8/10
BATTERY:‚ò∫Ô∏è
It has 4000mah Batter which is quite Good, Battery Backup depends on how You Use it. And For regular Use It was GREAT.
9/10
DISPLAY:üòç
I told you all In the Begging 10/10
OK DOES THIS VALUE FOR MONEY??ü§î
If You are a OnePlus Lover, Oxygen OS fan, if You want a GREAT Display Experience, and Superb Performance,
And not use cameras Much It's Absolutely Worth it.ü§ó
If YOU are Confusing to Buy 7pro or 7t Pro, I would suggest 7 Pro, Cuz only Tiny upgrades in 7t pro, And most of the 7t pro features comes to 7 pro as Updates, And Main This the Price has Dropped.üòÅ

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,After use of a week- Feels different,"Just buy it if your budget allows. Everything is premium in this phone. Display, Camera, performance everything is great. I saw few reviews, people comparing camera with low end phones. The difference is the new AI feature with mid range phone which is just a software upgrade. AI camera images looks great but are automatically editing when clicked. This is the reason people feel some mid ranged phone phones camera are good but actually that's not. That's just a software they use.
Taking that into consideration each and every thing is worth."

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Awesome phone,"OnePlus user for the past 3 yrs. Thought abt going for another brand; but then nothing came close to what OnePlus had to offer.
The display is just awesome - so fluid.
Fingerprint reader is really fast -- was a bit skeptical at first abt in-display FP reader; but this is almost as fast as a physical sensor.
Not the greatest battery life, but I won't complain, cuz I keep the display at 90Hz - and it's worth it.
Overall, I'd 100% recommend this phone to anyone who wants flagship level experience (and more) for way less money.

OnePlus 7 Pro,2,Totally disappointed with the Disaplay üò™,"The main reason why i bought this phone is my old C9 Pro broke and i needed a phone with good Display which can support HDR 10,Then i gone with the hype and finally bought this phone.but i got the problem with the display itself üò™ I wanted a phone with a gud display when i didn't get whta i want for so what do i do with the rest of the specs.After playing any 4K/HDR content ylloew color is appearing on the whole screen even when i put the screen calibration ""Cold"".
And when i on the reading mode its worse ....all dispaly is seems like someone spreaded Turmeric Powder on it & its not bright as many samsung's phones.i have been using my old samsung c9 pro for 3yeras and i knw it.
Being a movie lover i luv watching movies in my phone. Totally disappointed with the display.
OnePlus should update thier dispaly next time with more brighter screen."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,one plus 7 pro is an excellent phone,"I had read a lot of reviews before buying, but I must say that the product is really a nice buy. It is sleek, it is though large in one's hand, but takes great pictures both selfie as well as normal pictures. The feature of wide angle, normal and close up is a figure press away. Really has a long battery life for a normal use I could manage 1 and a half day, but if we do lot of (continuous when sitting idle!!!!) facebook and video running it comes for near about 3/4 of a day.  It is very fast and the fingerprint reader is really great."

OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Not a flagship killer anymore..,Screen and speed is good but that's all. Average camera and battery life is not great either. Poor delivery experience. Took full 6 days for delivery after multiple follow ups even though one day delivery was promised.
OnePlus 7 Pro,3,Average,All function are not so good or not so  bad it's average camera is good but when you zoom and take photos is not good in quality
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Loved it,Good phone with all features
OnePlus 7 Pro,3,Comparing screen display with the maker brand (samsung),"For all the hype of screen being best in market it is not up to the mark as compared to samsung galaxy screens. Although these screens are provided by samsung for one plus, the quality is descent. The rest of the functionality is good, except it heats or gets stuck at times on apps."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Perfect!,"Amazing Product, Really cant go wrong with this phone"
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Definitely 5‚≠ê,"The best mobile I have ever used..
The battery is very supportive and the picture quality is just awesome üëå. It is very user friendly"
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Great Mobile Phone! Only skeptical about after sales service by one plus.,"Great device! Great optimization of Oxygen OS with the hardware! Premium looks! Phone is heavy in hand! Camera is OK!  Wonderful screen of 90Hz! Ferrari like processor! Good battery life! Fast charging! Only worried about their after sales service,  heard that they charge heavy on hardware fault!"
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Flapship killer,"I am going to write a short review...
The packaging and the delivery was fast got the product 2days before delivery date..thanx to amazon.
Coming to the product,
For me the screen which is quad hd display along with 90hz refresh rate was the main reason i choose the phone.. Display(9.5/10)
Battery backup depends on the purpose you are using the phone for, for heavy usage it should last around 7 hours and in light to medium usage it should last for a whole day.. Battery(7.5/10)
Camera is the weakness that one plus devices have been facing the most..but thanx to the software updates and good software optimisation the camera is now good although if you are looking for a camera centric phone this is not the phone u are looking for.. Camera(7/10)
Special Note- This is not the best phone but with all the hardware and software optimisation this is the perfect balance that one plus has achieved and i must say that the display only is enough to blow you away...hope this helps you."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Sexy phone must buy,One plus he bhiya it's really amazing smart phone
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Seamless display and Awesome Phone,"Smooth, Speed and Superb"
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Original,Very good
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Good product,Good product
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Best Display ever on a smart phone,"Like Display, Sound, Processing speed and Design-Colour
Dislike heaviness and slippery surface and battery"
OnePlus 7 Pro,1,Worst phone amd not replacement policy,"Worst phone dont buy it. Heating up gradually and hanginh in sometime.
I raised it to Amazon but they are not providing any replacement pr refind for it."
OnePlus 7 Pro,1,Very Disappointed and disheartened . Think before shopping from amazon.,"I bought OnePlus 7 Pro(6GB, Mirror Gray)  from Amazon on 4 October 2019 in 'Amazon Great Indian Sale.
Seller Name - Rocket Kommerce LLP
On 9 Oct, my Phone delivered and I was doing the initial setup.
Suddenly an error occurred that showing ""Android Setup Keeps Stopping"" and Nothing happens. I stucked on this error screen. after restarting many times I did a factory reset and able to get home-screen.
1.  After getting an error on Brand New Phone on initial setup, I am assuming that this phone is tampered by the seller and contains fake parts.
2. when I ran speed test(Read&Write) of internal storage. The results are way less than actual ufs 3.0 storage even half.
read & write speed is same as ufs 2.1. It means internal storage is tampered or defective.
after this whole incident, I am very disappointed by Amazon."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Awesome but camera need to be improve.,Nice phone but headphone feature must be in it. If the head phone rearranged by the oneplus team Than it is super. But camera quality is also much than the other phones it is blurred so many times if ur hand is little bit shaky or or little bit ur moving the quality get worst. Oneplus team need to improve this system also for the camera quality for the moving person or little bit moving or shaky hands. Otherwise it is excellent for gaming or battery life.
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Super performance,Superb phone nothing more to say
OnePlus 7 Pro,3,One+7pro,Received a fulty display device. After using for a month i see few white spots( i guees some pixel for fram issue) on my screen..  i was not able  to exchange the device due exchange policy.
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Good,Nice
OnePlus 7 Pro,1,Worthless,Tell you that it is totally worthless phone
OnePlus 7 Pro,2,Worthless phone for the bomb price,"A very bad phone, for the money that we pay ATleast if not new features the best could be a normal phone. but this phones hangs a lot... no need of parallel running processes it just hangs. it feels devastating to spend so much for a worthless phone. The warp charge is worse than dash charge. Dash charging works faster than this warp charge."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Crystal clear,Value for money
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,"Forget all the other brands, Most premium phone ever made.",Guys don't believe in negative reviews. They probably don't value the device properly. Just go for it. Most premium phone ever and yes it's Oxygen OS runs through the tasks like a hot knife passing through butter. Before buying I never had an idea how fast it could be but now I'm experiencing the fastest phone in the market.
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,I think this is best phone for college student,Very nice product
OnePlus 7 Pro,3,Good Phone but Disappointed,Within a week value of phone diminished by 10k (2000 further discount + 1000 ap balance + 1 yr free screen replacement + etc). Lost trust and confidence in Amazon and OP........
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Mad phone!,Mad phone with spec's but as I am coming from iPhone legacy I feel warm in my hands while using 3/4G unlike iPhone which is so cool...
OnePlus 7 Pro,1,Phone is hangging,"Phone has a fine camera with a good finger print reader but a bad battery life as compared form one plus other phones also, also phone is hangging."
OnePlus 7 Pro,1,Poor Battery Backup,"Hai, After using 15 days, Phone is ok
But battery drain very fast. Photos are good.
The person who use more incoming and outgoing calls... This phone is not advisable..
Finally I am not Happy with this Mobile."
OnePlus 7 Pro,3,Average phone,Its a good phone to use. If you were a premium phone user from before you will not find any difference. Only differnce you might find is the display and camera because of pixels and refresh rate.You cannot use the phone if you are wearing a good quality gloves
OnePlus 7 Pro,1,Defective product,"Worst exprience
Phone is not starting
Showing Qualcom Crashdump Mode
Very bad service from amazon technician visit fixed after 3 days"
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Amazing Oneplus!,It‚Äôs a super phone. Incredibly fast and reliable. Display and camera are world class. I am happy I actually ordered this phone. Thank you Amazon!
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Aswome ü§≥,It's really good to have which I waited for long time. Feels delighted.
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Good quality,What about security in the phone
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,BEST PHONE EVERRRRRRR,Best phone one plus has never gone down it's specs are freaking amazing battery life is amazing
OnePlus 7 Pro,1,Network problem,"I'm facing problem with my network. After 1 min network stop working .WTF I can't use my data .
Is there any solution"
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Best of flagship,Love
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Great product,Awesome mobile
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Good product,Good product Worth of the money
OnePlus 7 Pro,2,Useless expenditure,"This phone should be good one as I have expected, but it is functioning like very cheap one. Phone heating issues are there. It is not up to the expectation."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Innovation at its best.,"Had the 6t before this and wanted to check this phone out for it's 90 hz display and QHD+ resolution. It turns out the hype is real and once you start using this display, it's hard to use the one on the 6t or any other phone (60 hz I believe). You can actually tell the difference.
The all-screen no-notch display is excellent and with 516 ppi, the display is very sharp and the performance is super fast. (I got the 12/256 version).
Although you can turn the display back to output 60hz, you'll get so used to the 90hz that you'll have a hard time adjusting.
Got it on the Diwali offer on Amazon with quick and damage-free delivery.
Don't really use the selfie camera much on any phone, so can't really comment on that. But it does help that it's hidden on top so that you get a notch-free display. Can't comment on the back camera either as I'm not really a big photo-taking person.
Should you get the 7t Pro instead of this? It depends, if you just want the McLaren edition or the 855+ chipset. Otherwise, this is an amazing option as it released just four months before and at the current price for the maxed out 12/256 version, it makes a lot of sense that you go for this."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Good phone,I like phone super phone üòçüòçüòçüòç
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Too good,One of the best mobile phone ever used. Even the sound having Dolby Atmos is powerful too. Nightmode is really awesome.
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Awesome,Awesome
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Poor battery life,My phone starts heating. It's been just 10 days that I got my OnePlus and it has started heating already. Battery life is poor though it's 4000 mah. Didn't get the warranty card in the box. Otherwise everything is fine.
OnePlus 7 Pro,1,Android Setup keeps on stopping error,"Android Setup keeps stopping. Error occurring everytime I try to start. It is highly disappointing to you know order the phone, wait for it to get it delivered and end up having it not even starting. All the hype that is created by marketing about One Plus seems to be absolutely fake. Very bad indeed."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,All are good,Good
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Best smartphone ever,Awesome phone
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Good flagship product. Delivery was good.,"At start the handset crashed,showing android had stopped working. Then I contacted One plus care and the advised to either replace or do the hard reset. The hard reset worked and the phone is working perfectly.
Performance,charging speed,camera,display everything is good. Sound clarity is also good. Overall a good flagship product. üòä"

OnePlus 7 Pro,1,One plus 7 pro poor working,"I am very much upset at the phones working. I have used one plus  3t, 5,  6, 6t but unfortunately this phone when in landscape mode blank screen is showing.  Being number one e-commerce site has to check in all parameters before despatch as customer buys only on name AMAZON  tag.  The set has to be replaced or repaired at doorstep by One plus. They have to sell genuine products when competitors increase"
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Simply Amazing,"Simply the best phone available at this price. It's so fast and never lags at all. And the screen, it's so beautiful and smooth, never seen anything like it. The battery is also good and easily goes for more than a day. The camera is also quite good and takes very good photos. Overall I am very happy with the phone."

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Phone of the year..,Loved it..
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,It's great but ..,"OnePlus has always been my brand of preference but the OnePlus 7 pro is slightly expensive for what's offered. No doubt the device is extremely powerful and a glory to look at, but paying ‚Çπ53,000 and not getting a pair of headphones or even a Type C to aux connector is a shame. Other than that, nice effort."
OnePlus 7 Pro,3,"Annoying finger print, bulky in size and weight",Finger print reader is annoying. It doesn't work like the how the traditional fringer print used to be. On screen finger print is a failure. The phone is slightly bulky in weight.

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Qi charging and 3.5 head phone jack,The phone should have Qi charging and 3.5  head phone jack facility
OnePlus 7 Pro,3,File transfer is too slow,File transfer is too slow to backup the data from old to new phone
OnePlus 7 Pro,1,Defective product,One of my worst experience with one plus 7 pro
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Ok,"Overall good, some bugs are there but manageable"
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Good phone but a little overpriced,"The best thing about this phone is the screen and battery life. Hands down the phone lasts for a full day with heavy screen on time and could last a day n half or even two with little usage. However, the camera is a big disappointment for me who is coming from Google pixel phone. Also, for the features and quality of this phone, I believe it could have been priced between 35-40k and not more."
OnePlus 7 Pro,1,I want bill,I want bill
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Best smartphone ever made,"This is best features you can get at this price. compare to other same range devices oneplus 7 pro is far far better in terms of display, camera and battery. I think its waste of money if your investing more than 50k for an I phone just for showing off think twice. Oneplus 7 pro having a best display and refresh rate high ."

OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Amazing product,My first one one plus device. Not given 5 üåü because of battery life..
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,The Phone of the Year!,"Beautiful fluid display. Well crafted design. Consistent Software support. Competitive pricetag. thats the oneplus charm.
Love everything about the 7 Pro. Finally feels like a truly flagship experience! The design is exquisite. Love the curves on that beautiful fluid 90Hz amoled panel. Just wish if the rear had more grip, because the phone is huge, a tad heavy and definitely slippery. You NEED a case.
As for the software xp, its amazing. Oxygen OS is subtle and imho better than stock android. The customizations arent in your face if you arent into it. Software support is really fantastic too.
Where i find lacking are the cameras. the lens hardware deserves so much better! dont get me wrong, the cameras are good. but it could do better- and i blame the color palette for that. Oneplus really needs to work on their camera software- which they have been improving so far. This definitely is the best cameras on a oneplus device so far.
Front camera is meh though. too much skin smoothening in that.
As for the price. Totally worth it!"

OnePlus 7 Pro,2,Not value for money,"Screen is great & treat to watch movies & videos. Don't really feel difference of 90hz. Software has glitches & apps crash sometimes. Bought fone after seeing camera ratings on Dox, but to my surprise the quality is very very average & portrait mode struggle a lot with image quality under good artificial lighting. Overall unimpressed with the fone after paying 50k. Hoping software updates will solve the issue. If want oneplus Suggest to buy cheaper 7t else of budget is good go for Samsung s10."

OnePlus 7 Pro,3,Excellent üëçüëçüëç,Totally fine
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Good but not best.,"This is a brilliant phone. I have been using this for a week now and here are my thoughts.
1.The weight
The phone is huge. I mean a bit too big for normal people. I have slightly above average sized hands so I have kind of gotten used to it. But if you have small hands you will struggle. The phone is hefty as well. I was using the LG V30 plus before this and that was unbelievably light, so that might be it.
2. The display
The display is beautiful and the 90hz along with UFS3.0 make the phone snappy and smooth. But after a while you kind of get used to the 90hz and becomes nothing special. But it will be missed when you use a 60hz one. The major complaint I have is the brightness. That is really bad and if you are outside a lot then that will definitely be a problem especially if you use dark mode. Since this phone is big you will notice bad quality videos to be very bad. Like 360p videos will look worse than normal.
3. Performance
This is something I don't need to say much about. I bought the 12gb ram version and it is smooth. The ufs3 storage is also awesome. Loading speed mind blowing. It's awesome
4. Camera
This is something I was really sceptical when I got this device. I use a dlsr so camera was not that big of deal for me. This take pretty good photos but I personally like the LG V30 camera better and it's a personal choice and this camera is not bad at all. It's a decent camera. The front camera is really good. All you selfie addicts will probably love this one. At least it's way better than the V30 which I had which was horrible.
On the whole one thing I noticed is this phone lacks refinement that one would expect for a 50k phones. Also the fingerprint sensor is a tad bit slower not that noticable. But it won't work when you hands are wet or when your skin is peeling off or something like that. Battery life is not mind blowing. On the whole this is a phone that is not worth it's original price. I got it for around 45k and for that I'm more than happy."

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Powerful smartphone till now!,"Pros:
The phone is just amazing and its best part is 90hz refresh rate..it makes the phone like sliding over the butter and the warp charge 30 is amazing..like it charges almost 50% in half an hour.its not officially IP rated water test..but it could quite stay in a glass of mug for couple of minutes. The pop-up cam is tested for 300,000 guaranteed.
Cons:
no headphone jack.
Feels a little bit heavy.(manageable)
Conclusion :
Best phone features with least affordable price."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,A great flagship killer other than the 7t,"If there's one thing that caught my eye when my colleague bought this phone is the display. It was a stunning 2k+ Quad HD display after all. It then lead me to look for video reviews from the youtube experts. It turns out, they did appreciate the display and phone. It's amongst the best displays on a phone in recent times and it's a Samsung panel.
Pros of this phone:
1. Ultra smooth beautiful quad hd screen with a 90 Hertz display. It is 6.67 inches in size including the curved edges. It's great for social media,videos which can render in 1440p if available and for reading too. It also does not have a notch and you pretty much love it.
2. Battery life with a 4000 MAH battery is great when you consider that you use a 90 Hz refresh vivid qhd screen. Your could switch to 60 Hz but nah. :)
3. Back cameras do a good job in capturing pics. An yet to really test them. The front 16 mp pop up camera works well. It's a good camera setup.
4. It's got the SD 855 processor and it's butter smooth and fast.
5. With the oxygen OS, it delivers near stock Android experience. It will very soon be upgraded to 10.
6. Warp charging: it's got crazy fast charging compared to op6 which I have before this and 90% will get your through the day and more.
7. The on screen finger print sensor is great to use.
Cons:
1. It's a heavy phone at 200 grams. You will take a week to get used to it since we all are so adaptive.
2. It's got a curved display with curved edges. Accidental Ghost touches do occur from time to time. Also, your need to be careful. If you drop it face down, it will fall on the screen side given its weight and with the curved edges, there is a chance to break.
3. With the launch of the OP7t, One plus has diluted the significance of this phone. We Indians are price conscious and the OP 7t costs 7k lower than each of the OP 7 pro models even after prices dropped on the 7 plus pro (OP 7 pro costs 4k lesser than when launched 6 months ago).
Update: just found that there's a One Plus 7t Pro launching on October 10th 2019. With it, this will be definitely be the undisputed OP Flagship.
4. For the price, no type C to 3.5 mm jack connector in the box, no type C ear phones, no wireless charge, no waterproof certification but you do get a case.
Verdict:
If you want the great screen, FHD+ 2K+ display, 90 Hz refresh and notch less design, go for the one plus pro. If you want most of what pro has, a balanced phone, some additional features and are ok with the 2k display and notch screen design, go for One plus 7t which is a super budget flagship killer too."

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Excellent!!!,"I'm a long time user of the Samsung Galaxy S and Note series. I was using these phones since the Note 1 came out. I decided to give the Oneplus 7 Pro a try due to 2 reasons - first is the cost to value proposition and second, the software experience. I am using the Google Pixel 3 as my second phone and anyone who uses the Pixel series knows the pleasure in using a great phone with even better software. The software experience clubbed with the hardware is what separates Google phones from the rest. I can now say the same thing about the OnePlus 7 Pro. It is great hardware combined with excellent software which is the Oxygen OS. It is buttery smooth, fast, responsive, and useful.
I'll stay away from the specs, battery life, performance, etc. You can look up countless of those details and reviews on the web. But take it from me, this phone is a complete package (hardware and software). I'm in love with the feel of the phone and also the software. For the price, it's an excellent deal. Go for it. I bought this instead of the Note 10+ and happy on having saved 35k."

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Advice you to go for Samsung or Apple,"I am using this phone from last  2.5 months.
Likes:
Oxygen OS from Oneplus is big plus for this phone. It is very stable varient of android available in the market.
Fingerprint Scanner is very fast.
Camera quality is decent.
Battery life is also good that it last about a day with average screen on time of about 7 hours.
Thanks to 30W charger which comes with it in the box.
Phone is performing very good. I have used this phone for 800 hrs up time. But found nothing serious.
Dislikes:
Brand: OnePlus is giving awesome phone each time but within 6 months it comes with OnePlus 7T with better performance and features than OnePlus 7 Pro at lower price. They are not maintaining the value of their flagships. I have spent 58k for this phone and now I feels like I have paid for wrong device.
I advice all to go for Samsung or Apple iPhones because they are maintaining value of their flagships for at least a year.
Camera: It will miss some frames when recording in slow motion. Also there are many flaws in camera system which may be resolved with software updates.
At last I will say that Amazon service was very poor. When I ordered this phone from Amazon, It was reached at Amazon's local facility whithin two days. But As I am a non prime member, they took 2 more days for delivery. They were able to deliver the phone within 2 days but they didn't."

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,"One plus 7 pro 8GB, 256 GB Nebula Blue","Wow. What I can say. Speed, camera quality, video viewing experience, 90hz refresh rate, fast charging. Somewhat expensive. But the kind of experience and feel you get by using the phone is simply superb. I hardly write feedbacks but the phone quality output made me do that. However, some basic things like lack of 3.5 mm video jack, a wireless headphone could have been given or else at least the type c to 3.5 mm converter could have been given with the pack."

Torch gets switched on without any rhyme or reason. suddenly the finger print sensor becomes slow and sluggish. Would not recomment to others. Had used Galaxy 7 for three years without a hitch.
One plus 7 pro after 5 months of inconsistent usage has suddenly gone dead, and no one neither Amazon or one plus seven is responding."

Battery(4/5) - Battery backup is also good
Screen (5/5)- screen is very smooth with 90hz refresh rate, brightness & colors are very good
Warp Charge (3.5/5) - there is no bigger difference between Dash charge & WARP charge if u used Dash charge u won't feel bigger difference
As i feel there is only a big problem with device is headphone jack...they even didn't gave a USB TYPE-C to 3.5mm Adapter with box‚òπÔ∏è

OnePlus 7 Pro,1,Terrible Ram Management in 6gb variant,No doubt phone is great but the biggest drawback of 6gb variant is that the RAM Management is terrible.

Customer service person in tnagar chennai informed that the touch screen is gone but mobile is in good condition but nothing can be done from their end because they are giving only one year warranty after one year they are not responsible point to be noted is that they are talking about 40k mobile... pathetic

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Simply Awesome,Great phone in this range. Really feels premium in usage. Got it for 44999.
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,"Awesome, worthy upgrade","I had been using LG G7 thinq+ for a year and now changed to one plus family. Excellent mobile, no lag ( with 12gb RAM no phone will lag in performance ), nice camera and nightscape mode works excellently. Screen quality is awesome and battery lasts for full day with 5 hours of screen on time and always on mobile data. Signal quality is better than LG as this phone has high SAR value ( 1.1 to 0.4 ). Warp charge is fine takes about 1 hour 30 mins for 100% battery from 10%. Overall complete package.
UI wise some features like selecting sim for call is not as easy as in LG, audio quality is not that much nice compared to LG as this doens't feature HiFi Quad DAC system. Wireless charging is a feature that i miss. AI is missing in camera segment"

I have the 12gb RAM with 256gb memory variant. Has zero glitches while running CPU intensive apps. The selfie camera mechanism is quite sturdy and safe. All in all, whatever OnePlus claims for this phone is true. The only con is that it doesn't come with a type C to 3.5 mm Jack adapter/ converter."
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Very good product,Product is as per description. Screen guard had bubble. Camera quality is good.Battery when charged 100% will run full day. Speed is good.

OnePlus 7 Pro,1,Beware about NO COST EMI,"1 star for Amazon not to phone
Don't buy on NO COST EMI else you will regret on your decision. I bought it on No cost now I am paying EMI og 9127‚Çπ per month with 800‚Çπ tax and gst.
Overall I am playing 9927‚Çπ for 6 months that means I will pay them 59,562‚Çπ
That was a biggest nightmare in my life.
Phone is awesome but price manipulation was also awesome"
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Flagship killerü§©,Best phone to beat the premium flagship smartphoneüòÄüòÄüòÄ
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Premium phone,5 star for everything.
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Bang for the buck if you get all the exchange and affordibility options,"Pros:
1. Display is the most smooth and fluid I have ever used
2. Battery Backup is auperb, just half an hour charge enough to last for the day
3. Oxygen OS is the best Android Skin
Cons:
1. The portrait mode is the most annoying feature of the camera, it uses the telephoto and one has to stand at least 1 m away to click a feature
2. Quite heavy in weight, will take some time to getting used to it"
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Nice one,"Excellent phone for that price range,screen is one of the best selling point of this mobile and it‚Äôs provide that also."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,All in all nice product,"With best display and sound quality... Camera is decent, fast performance... No lag in gaming...  Fast charge js nice , battery is decent.... little bulky and big, difficult to hold in one hand. Im happy with phone"
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,"Feel the power - OnePlus 7pro, caption this!!!!","One plus7 pro is just the phone I wanted. I strongly believe this is one of the best phones I have ever used. The camera is just amazing, the processor is too good.... With an amazing look!!!"
OnePlus 7 Pro,2,Buy it if u want a beautiful display ot else gp for 7t,"Okay... it's just plain bad... don't buy it better go for one plus 7t.They just killed their own flagship, i'm freaking disappointed for buying this. There's no mecro mode in it but  7t got it covered in 20 k cheaper than this crap. the display is amazing but everything else is fine not that good...same as 7t it even got better camera than 7 pro lol...with such a high price it only gives a curved display that's it.if u really want a beautiful display go for it...but if u're fine with a notch goo for 7t and save like 15-18k. I wish i could return this soo that i could buy the 7t and save myself some money. Wanted the best but the best got killed by its own flagship xD.just regrets."
OnePlus 7 Pro,1,"Before I buying OnePlus 7pro,  I love this phone very much and after I hate it","Worst phone ever, while I playing pubg the app is automatically closing always , what I do now ?"
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Overall this is a good buy,Loved it
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,On,Good Mobile
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Outstanding,Value for money
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,AMAZING,HOOPFOOL
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Most acceptable product,Excellent
OnePlus 7 Pro,1,Unlocking doesn't work,It's very bad experience for me. I am not sure about camera and battery life.  Because the very first day when I was trying to do device set up it got locked and I couldn't not unlock it by any means.  Amazon sent the technician for it to be fixed.  But it was really an unpleasant experience.  Really I feel like this phone is not worth buying by spending a huge amount. It's a dabba phone.
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Still One Of The Best In The Market,"Well being a OnePlus user from the 5th Generation of their models, I would say they've come out to be one of the best players in the competition.
Talking about the Display it's fantastic, you would love to use this device all the time when it is in your hand. I wouldn't say it's big, but rather it's immersive. And rhe refresh rate is just the icing on the cake.
The battery life is also nice, much better than I thought as a day would be enough for a heavy user, and there's no need to worry as the Warp Charger is there to help you out.
Now the main weakness on of this phone is the camera. Well it's not that bad but it's not what everyone would expect from a OnePlus device for the premium pricing, well it's kind of descent, much more similar to the previous generations, just the wide angle lens is the main centre of attraction.
And at last the built quality and performance, hands down, unbeatable!"
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,OnePlus flagship phone,I would stick out my head and say this is the fastest phone on planet. Battery life is pretty good with close to 5hrs sot. Camera quality needs to be improved especially during indoors.
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,never settle for less,"Bought 12 gb ram. Amazing phone and got a great deal too...
Superb camera and superb speed."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Nice but costly,Nice but it's costly .. as one plus 7 is also better option

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Outstanding,As usual.. Awesome !
OnePlus 7 Pro,3,Feels PICKLED out after 3 months of usage--- of O+ 7 PRO,"Update after 3 months of usage--- (mainly professional usage)
Main pointers -
Avg UX, UI.
Buttery smooth exp to work across all multitasking & data / memory usage done (optimising improvement is begged).
Major disappointments in occasional PHONE HANGS. Inappropriate & sudden change/disappearance of Software buttons.
Sudden Magnifications
Bugged issues without ever using any shady apps or functions / data / updates
Poorly Informed USER community of O+ & service troubleshooting.
The phone didn't quiet throw us off the hook & wow us. Though it was a decent phone the PRICING is definitely pickled out for a 7pro 256Gb device.
The TOUCH is somewhat shaky, the kind of conviction one should feel shouldn't come through. The edges sometimes don't register well or register incorrectly according to application. Fr ex while typing this text at times the characters at the edges of the screen didn't register well while clicking perfectly on to it.
USER INTERFACE & USER EXP - is probably so-so. Some diehard fans may not agree but my sister can emulate how it's not really matching upto standards expected of a flagship phones after using brands like Samsung or Apple. From the beginning one has felt that OP7PRO may not give us full convictions while using it, it has to work convincingly well. The issues may lie in incoherent ways of APP /SOFTWARE /HARDWARE design. Maybe the efficiency still needs to be Upped.
SERVICE ISSUES seem to be plaguing from beginning, as mentioned earlier. However can't be called as issue as such. But later 60-90 days after purchase from AMAZON, the bloody thing started acting crazy. Sisters data was at risk and also official stuff couldn't be foregone. Servicing within 90days of purchase has really made it unpleasant n unconvincing. As a professional my sister wouldn't use anything shady from 3parties. Yet seems like suddenly bugs appear from nowhere, or some issues which are not directly claimed responsibility by OP+service teams and leadership teams of services.
Servicing was done obviously but we didn't like that a phone goes berserk so soon. Service Manager at Brigade Bangalore, sorted issues after a marathon call of 6hours with call center who couldn't fix issue on call. Service engineer obviously fixed the issue with something called a QTIP PIE reset Something, IAM not sure of (press power+volume button simultaneously for 30+seconds). It might have fixed issues temporarily only though.
REMORSE RATING??
One does feel a little off-put buying this device & hasn't really satisfied. Some issues while usage one can feel it's incompetencies... Though one cannot prove it. Basically User experience is not at par with flagship highest standards achieved by Smartphone industry.
At the end of the Day it has made us feel to switch to another BRAND or look for upgrade to 7T but still with scepticism."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Super,Super
OnePlus 7 Pro,1,No cost EMI discount not deducted,No cost EMI not deducted from price and getting charged on credit card. As per price 43393.01/12 should be my EMI but is getting charged on no cost EMI interest included i.e.  3926.58*12=47118.96

4) Warp charging is much more faster than Dash charging  + battery retention time is average
5) 90Hz barely makes a difference as compared to OnePlus 3 I used before this. But yes, Its indeed much more refined and smooth(still doesn't justify the price tag)
Bad Points:
1) The camera although takes awesome pictures, but it does get blurred while zooming and viewing the pic from gallery
2) The pop up mechanism makes mechanical sound while switching on/off. At this price, it bothered me. It could have been seamless.
3) Bit heavy and huge. Gives a feeling of nervousness while holding it without any case(as its made of glass body)
4) front camera is average. Similar to OnePlus 5T I would say(not much difference)"

This phone is not a phone,it's a luxury in ur hand,mind blowing performance,best in the segment, every photo wallpaper anything u see in this phone looks mesmerizing, wat else u ecxpect from a phone Yar,go for it blindly.
This review  I'm posting after 20 days of using.
Battery backup is superb,if u put the screen for 60hz.
Display is best no cons in it.
Processor...do I need to remind u it's one plus?
No doubt the best speed and processor.
Camera ..yes here it's ur personal choice I can't really say it does the best but yes for me ..it's more than enough yaar...I mean after Snapseed all photos are classic, don't expect to replace this camera from ur DSLR. üòÑüòÑ
Body...yes keep it secured back glass is delecate ,always prone for the scratched and even cracks.
Charging ...wrap charger the best of all very quick speed ,no issues of heating till now.
I'm not a game lover so...can't say much about it..
Honestly if I say...then don't go for costly I phones and Samsung sets even not with Huawei, go for this cream yaar...u and yr generations will enjoy the class of one plus.

The service centers declared that liquid damage is the reason and the cost will be 17000.00. Now, how can a person prove that it was not dip on water and its already water splash proof as declared on amazon. Very poor service and will not recommend for one+ series."
OnePlus 7 Pro,1,motherboard issue in just 2 months of its purchase,"I have bought one plus 7 pro(8+256gb blue color variant,EMEI=865166046634658,865166046634641) from amazon by my brother's id and within 2 months of its purchase, I stared getting heat issue and then all of sudden the motherboard of the phone got spoiled. Its really disappointing and I was not expecting this type of issue from such reputed and high ending phone. So personally I would like to suggest that don't buy this phone go for some other low range phone that would be much better than one plus 7 pro."

Pros:
1. Stunning screen
2. Monster of a performance. Never had any lag, any crash in one month.
3. Oxygen OS is just as good if not better than stock Android.
Cons:
1. Poor wide angle on selfie camera
2. Slow fingerprint reader
3. This is no match to Pixel in photography department, not by a long shot, even with the GCam app."

False stops on slider button, i.e you can slide to an in-between position between in these settings -(ring, vibrate, silent).
Volume control lags alot.
Fingerprint is slow and often fails to recognize.
Better go for OnePlus 7 as it would feel worth the money."

OnePlus 7 Pro,3,Lack of features and accessories at huge cost,"It was slightly better than all basic Chinese phones..like Mi note6/7 pro.. but a big miss in VOLTE CALLING /VOWIFI feature is not available even in oneplus 7pro models.. big disaapoinment at huge cost.
Don't buy unless you don't want to use VOLTE or VOWIFI features..as this phone overpriced with lack of VOLTE calling features..in India..
Also basic headphone jack converter should be given along with the inbox items after all we are.paying huge money.. company is not interested to give us the headphones .or wireless headphones even..
I have a feeling of wasting 52,999 rupees in it."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Must buy phone,"Awesome product , full value for money"
OnePlus 7 Pro,1,It explodes!,"Hey Oneplus! Your phone exploded. Yes yours. It exploded. It exploded at 5am in the morning.  It exploded right next to me when it was charging and I was sleeping.  I woke up to the smell of something  burning. Fortunately it wasn‚Äôt me, and it could have been me, very easily. It was a oneplus 3t, just over two years old (good enough reason for it to explode?). I had to throw it off the bed to stop the bed from burning down, burnt a finger though. Attached is the picture, of the phone, not my finger because I don‚Äôt  thing you ever were concerned  about my safety when you made the phone. You say ‚ÄòNever Settle‚Äô. I say to you ‚Äònever again' will I ever settle for a oneplus."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,#TOP 1 best phone,"It's currently the world's best phone, having 90hertz refresh rate with QHD amoled display.
Best haptic touch and excellent stereo sounds.
I must say it is also the world's fastest phone..."
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Mid tier king??!!!,"A fantastic phone for the price, although as for OnePlus standards the price is bit too high but considering current crop of smartphone offering same specs one could argue this phone worth the asking price.
Build quality is really good as with any modern flagship smartphone.and a fantastic display to compliment excellent build quality. I would say the best display OnePlus put to a smartphone since it's inception. Colors are vivid and punchybut not as oversaturated as Samsung. Camera has been improved a lot. 48MP main camera does a good job in good lighting condition. Although the inclusion of ultrawide camera is a welcome addition the quality of the photo you receive from this sensor is not on par with the main camera. It s
is to be expected since it is using much smaller sensor than the main one. But the two photos using these camera is Stark contrast with one another. It is the same story with telephoto lens as well.
Fingerprint sensor on this smartphone is an under disply optical sensor, although this technology in paper will sound good but in practice the technology is not matured yet and much slower than the capacitive one we used to.
But one area this smartphone redeem itself is the display, the 90hz display in the OnePlus is one of the best display in any smartphone right now. It is an absolute delight to use in everyday.
Then there is software. OnePlus's skin on smartphone is the best other than the stock Android. It is smooth and highly responsive and overall much better experience than the other manufactures tend to do with their software.
In summery it's a looker of a smartphone that has some great features display and software experience among those and some so-so features like camera and in display fingerprint reader."

OnePlus 7 Pro,2,Flash lit sensor problem,"Problem in flash light. It is giving less light when required, and light up automatically while speaking phone"
OnePlus 7 Pro,3,Not as good as I heard it was supposed to be.,Phone build is good. Takes some time to get used to the device after using Samsung for the last 7 years. Have been using for almost 2 months and it has got stuck/hung a couple of times. Several times when a dialled number could not connect I would get  loud beeping sound and no way to turn it off other than to restart the phone! The phone dialer disappears mid way sometimes so no way to use dialer features during the call including disconnecting the call - this is quite irritating. Expected a better finger print reader.
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,One plus,Refreshing speed as very best..and fingerprint reader better than other phone camera quality is cool.... battery life is super cool....one plus always the best phone I ever seen

OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Excellent phone with an average battery life,"Phone looks great. Phone is bit bigger but that's ok. I wish it would have been of 6 inches just like iPhone. The curved display is super cool. The camera quality is amazing.
CONS:
1) Battery life. Phone lasts for atmost 6.5hrs of continuous usage.
2) Price should have been around 42K. 49K is a huge amount.
3) Phone is a bit heavy. One plus should try to minimise the weight."
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Honest review after 7 days of usage with PROS & CONS :,"Lets not start a paragraph & jumping into pros & cons :
PRO'S ;
Screen : The screen is really impressive & the slight curved edges are adding an awesome impression every time you look at the display .
Speed : It has 0 lag . Currently I am using op7 pro 8Gb variant & it runs without any lag till now .
Have played games like pubg & asphalt but it runs smooth & fast without any issues .
Also no major heating issues has been observed even after running pubg for more than 2 hours .
Camera : Its a next generation camera which I have not experienced before . The low light images are mind blowing & can compare with any DSLR . The AI camera quickly adopts to any scene automatically & switches its mode . Landscape photography even at night seems pretty awesome .
The front camera is pretty much realistic & will give a genuine image without much beauty or skin smoothing effect . (Those can be added externally if you wish) .
Fingerprint / Face unlock : Works more than fine .
Battery : Really awesome . gives around 6 hours of Screen on time with constant FB / Messenger / insta / you tube stream / 2 hrs of pubg on high graphics . Without gaming you can have 8 hours of S.O.T without any doubt
Add on : It has horizon lightning instead of notification LED . Every time you receive a notification the edge will glow up . It looks quite premium & stylish .
Delivery & packing : Within a single day without any issue .
CON'S :
The phone is quite heavy compared to my previous one plus 5 . It really pains the fist if you grab it single handed for long time as its 208 gm . (Still you can manage it I believe as its not a thor's hammer ).
No notification LED . Instead of that ambient display & horizon lightning is there but still i prefer the edge old notification LED .
No 3.5 mm jack . You can buy a type c to 3.5 mm converter spending 250 rs more from Amazon  .
No more cons . Overall its a performance phone with a premium look , holding it you can stand out of the crowd & can make yourself an attraction point :)"
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Awesome phone,"Awesome phone, but little heavy"
OnePlus 7 Pro,2,Phone is gud,"Yup fingerprint reader is not dat gud as i thought , camera is gud not best same as oneplus 6 only 1 thing is different is the wide angle view and last but not the least battery is draining very fast overall the phone is okay not the best"
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Best phone in the market right now,"First of all this phone is value for money
The camera quality is phenomenal
Except for the front camera performance in dark confition is very poor
The finger print scanner is not that accurate
The battery life is very good
Best battery in any smart phone
The display is great
Potrait mode is avg
Night scape mode is amazing
Better than s10 plus in all aspects
If you are confused btwn note 10 pls and op7pro
Go for op7pro"
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Good but could be better.,"Great phone, but if they had given a wireless charging system and a c type earphones. It would have been the best phone."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Smartphone,Best smartphone
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Perfect phone with an amazing camera,"The Oneplus 7 Pro is a stunner. Gorgeous design. At the rear it had a 3 camera setup. All three work amazingly. The 3x telephoto actually helps and gives very clear pictures. The nightscape mode is the best I've seen till now. The results are stunning to say the least. Check the attached pictures. None of these have been reprocessed. The screen is smoother beauty. Full saturated colours and perfect. I'm not sure I'm fond of the curved screen though. The call quality and reception is perfect. The BT range of excellent. The 2 external speakers are unexpectedly, actually very good. The battery life is more than adequate. In my normal use its still at 70% in the evening. Like all the preceding Oneplus models this too is blazingly fast.
If I have a grouse outs the automatic screen brightness. It's absolutely useless. It does nothing. My Oneplus 5t controlled brightness really well. Is this a deal breaker? Not one bit. This is the best mobile for me and the one that gives real bang for the buck"
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Go for samsung note 10..,Finger print reader doesnt work smtimes.. camera quality is good but not so good ..  low light quality is poor..battery is ok..

Best experience so far. And with Android 10 in future, it's going to be even better than what it is right now."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Very Good Performance,"Very Good Performance, some improvements required in fingerprint reader."
OnePlus 7 Pro,1,Pathetic Product From One Plus,"I had purchased one Plus 7 pro 8 GB Almond color from Amazon based on a friend's suggestion but totally regret the purchase. I'm a new user for One Plus & previously owned Apple, Vivo,Letv, Coolpad, Samsung, Honor, Motorola,Xolo,etc.,never experienced such an awkward performance in those mobile's. Spending half a Lakh Indian rupees on this mobile the File manager videos file's takes time to load in order to open the same, While on call second call gets answered automatically, Both front & Back camera clarity are not up to the mark & there are lots of other issues while using the mobile I'm not at all happy using this device & feel like exploited for buying a premium range mobile with a basic mobile's performance. Need a solution for the same at the earliest."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Happy customer....,"Very happy with the phone. First time in my life I never regret for the money I spent.
This phone is brilliant, gone are the day's when I used Samsung with battery draining and all other anomalies.
Speed, battery is perfect, screen, photos.
You'll never regret in you buy OnePlus 7 pro. ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞"
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,"Nothing is perfect, still it packed a lot of features which make it nearly perfect smartphone.","Overall the phone is awesome, as mentioned by OnePlus it's the speed you need this phone actually delivers the speed you need. But somethings are not upto the mark such as it's fingerprint sensor many a times it does not work properly and does not recognize the fingerprint, camera is not upto the mark as expected by a phone worth ‚Çπ53000/- and battery life is more or less okay I haven't felt like charging it again before going to sleep."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Valuable Phone,Awsm Phone i ever had.Thnx ONE+
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Must be better as compared to other one plus low priced mobiles,"Fingerprint is superb, working smoothly.
Camera quality is worse as compared to One plus 3t, At this price segment camera needs lots of improvement ,also battery charging is outstanding but should work on backup accordingly to such price segment..."
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Buy it for speed,30wt fast charger
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Super,Exalant OnePlus 7pro
OnePlus 7 Pro,1,Don't buy OnePlus products.my phon get totally mad,"Don't buy one plus product.
After 1 year my OnePlus 5t is not working.

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Awesome,Loved it
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Nice Product,"It's battery pretty disappointing. One plus does not provide earphone which is required to be purchased additionally. The charger  wire should have been a bit longer. It's curved edges are really adding to it's elegant look. Speaker quality is not at par with Samsung A series. It's camera performs exceptionally well in night. But my experience with Amazon while purchasing the One Plus 7 Pro, is simply horrible. One needs huge spare time to describe the series of incidents, to be exact FIVE number of times. Overall it's a nice buy & can go for it."

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Works like a champ !!!!,I've seen couple of negative reviews about this phone and trust me don't listen to any one of those I've been using this phone for more than 3 months and kudos to oneplus they've improved this phone so much by the help of software updates bvoz at first there were some bugs like camera was not upto the mark front camera used to get opened inside my pocket but within a month or so it was all fixed and now this phone is perfet the camera is amazing like literally and battery performance is decent considering the 90hz and qhd display fingerprint reader is also pretty good works 95% of times for me and software obviously it's OnePlus so no problem there aswell so overall  a brilliant phone now i know people criticized oneplus for making a expensive phone but trust me what it offers compared to something like s10 plus this thing is still a way better value the only thing that is missing is wireless charging i guess if you are doing a glass back then you have to have wireless charging though the warp charge is very fast so at the end i would say just go for it don't even think twice .

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Satisfied with it,"I read more reviews on this phone and saw many videos of reviews and tech experts many of them say that it's the best phone in Android. As they mentioned seriously it's the really the best phone. Best features. I took 8gb ram 7 pro.
1. Display, 2. Touch, 3. Camera, 4. Speed, 5. Design, 6. Battery life, 7. Fast charge.
Drawbacks
1. No headset jack.
2. Portrait mode is only for limited distance.
3. Memory card slot.
As it is the premium phone and paying 53k we expect basic things like headset jack or the headset. But didn't even give the music jack connector.
All the premium phones have wireless features but we miss in this phone. Hope it comes in next version."

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Simply amazing build and beauty,Awesome product
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,"You might this is overpriced for a OnePlus, but it's not. Review after 3 months.","Let's start with the first thing that you would notice - size.
It's a big phone, yeah. But, after 2 weeks you won't notice. It will feel just perfect in hand (if you don't use a cover on this). With a cover, it's still alright. And yeah, I've been using Galaxy S7 and Lg G7, meaning small phones, always. So yeah, size won't bother you and it feels as premium as a phone can get.
Next, Display - I compared the display to S10, S10 Plus, Note 9, Pixel, iPhone. I love this display in every aspect. Everything will always look better. Maybe because of the larger size or actual display quality, I don't know. It's the best I've had. Outdoor visibility is a little less (only when you compare with others), but it will get the job done easily.
Battery - Do not go through online review. It'll last a full day easily on heavy use. I'm getting a day and a half - 4 hrs Sot with 32-38 hrs or 7+ hours sot on weekends with a 18-22 hrs standby. Even it doesn't; You won't ever feel it. Charges in no time, Doesn't heats up while charging (even when you're using it). It's getting better after each day.
Camera - Again, getting better after each update. I'm on android 10 open beta preview and you get all the features that you want. Every function enabled on each sensor. Default setting is great, detailed images, perfect balance. And, when you want to tweak, Pro mode is there. You don't need anything else when it comes to cameras. Btw, when comparing the pictures between S10 and 7 Pro, you'll like the 7 pro just cause of the display.
Performance - Do I really need to review this? Just cut the animation scale to 0.5x in developer mode and it feels crazy. Not a single hiccup so far. This is the best performer in the industry.
You won't get better experience than this. You may buy other flagships because you though the camers might be better or battery or blah blah. This the best thing in the market right now. Or, just wait for the 7T pro. 1 months maybe. Best thing ever.
But, get a framless cover for 500, it will maintain the sleek feel of the phone. Don't try any uv screenguards, they are horrible. Use the stock screenguard or simple protectors.
Cheers!"

Backglass of my phone broke badly due to accidental fall even from table height (approx 3 feet), back cover was in place place though...replace the glass at approx cost of 3000/-..
then I bought rhinoshield bumper case with front and back impact flex screen guard...claimed to protect phone upto 11 meter fall..but this time when my mobile falls...it got front n back glass broken with damage to motherboard also!! Not expected this poor build quality at this price point..specially when rhinoshield case n screen protection was also there..now they claim repair cost of 49,000...as good a new!!!
Not at all durable..even after paying this much price..."

All other companies like oppo, xaiomi etc providing high value on their old device for upgrading new ones.. Unfortunately one plus not giving fair value for there own customer for upgrading new one plus phones. If we brought one plus 6t last year at ‚Çπ33000 ,the exchange value will be ‚Çπ9500 after 1 year. The value of the top mobile brand diminished to below 30% within 1 year.. Please provide better exchange value for oneplus devices for upgrading new one. It will help to all oneplus family members to continuing part of your journey."

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Go for it with your eyes closed.,"I have been using this for quite few months and first look is very impressive. The curved edge to edge display gives very premium feel. Here is how it goes for performance-
1. Display is bright and no problem in reading even in outdoors. Scratch resistance is impressive. I am not using any tempered glass or screenguard and I don't find any scratches till now.
2. Battery is impressive and quick charge is really quick about 40-45 mins for full charge.
3. Processor is best, no lag ,no hanging and no heating isuues even with heavy use.
4. Audio is decently loud and clear.
5. Camera is the best part of this phone. Back and front both cameras give awesome clear pictures. I will try to add few samples here and you can judge by yourself.
6. Just one issue with fingerprint sensor in display and I found that on screen sensor is not as sensitive as sensors on back."

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Extraordinary,Nothing
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Ultimate,I like this
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Review,Good product
OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Close to perfection,Fingerprint can be more smooth
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Blazing Quick.,"This is my first phone in the premium category and I'm glad I went ahead with investing those extra 20000 rupees for a phone. 12 GB of RAM will look after every thing that you can ever ask of a phone. I had no idea of what difference a screen of 90Hz refresh rate or 60Hz meant. But after using this phone and having seen my friend's 6T I can say that a 90 Hz screen is so buttery smooth that it spoils you. Fingerprint scanner has gotten better with every touch. Battery performance isn't too great but it does charge lighting quick. The curved screen and the Fluid Amoled Display just packs that final punch.
It's not always we think of going for a 50k+ phone and if you're thinking of upgrading your phone and have the budget, go for OP7Pro without any apprehensions.
Edit: I'm no pro photograper but the camera seems to be better with additional features after the Android 10 update."

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Excellent Phone,Amazing phone. Very smooth to use. Great experience.
OnePlus 7 Pro,2,"Phone is top notch, but has some flaws","Phone is really good, there is no doubt. But there is a major flaw in the phone- the pop up selfie camera. Suppose, you have kept the phone in your trouser pocket, with the pop camera downwards. Suddenly, a friend of yours makes a video call to you. Then, automatically, the pop up camera will come out, even if you pick up the video call or not. Then, if there isn't sufficient space for the camera to pop out fully, the motor inside will fail and your front camera will never come out. Now in that case, you may not be able to claim warranty since this would be an user made damage. I bought that phone and realised, it was my biggest mistake. Secondly, I noticed that the finger print sensor was not at all secure. Suppose, you are sleeping and you have some sensitive content in your phone which you want to keep as a secret. Then, anyone can use your thumb to unlock the phone and have access to all your personal data. I am using iPhone XS Max and believe me, nothing is as much secure as the Face ID. So think twice, before buying it."

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Its the best phone anyone can ever buy in 2019,In india as i know the only phone which we can get which is occupied by a snapdragon 855 is oneplus. No other companies doesn't even lauch their flagship models in india. There are only rare options. And in case of oneplus it is the best phone anyone can buy. Its not about value they offer but its how good this phone is. Every year when companies lauch new phone i was neber impressed. This is the one which tempted me to upgrade and its worth every penny
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Awesome daily driver,"This is the best phone I ever had from one plus. Following are the pros and corns. Let me start with pros followed by corns next :
Pros :
1). Best in class display.  It has overtaken even the Samsung phones. However it‚Äôs AMOLED panel is made by Samsung.
2).  Best camera experience. Better than Samsung S10.
3).  90 Hz refresh rate on the screen. First in its segment.
4). Dash Charge :  hi speed charging, achieves 100%  within an hour.
5). Battery lasts for more than a day for medium to heavy usage with data on.
6). Does not heat up so it‚Äôs predecessors as it comes with liquid cooling panel. Ideal for heavy gamers.
Corns :
1).  The device is very heavy it weighs around 210 g
2). Very slippery in nature Due to its glossy finish. Back cover is must.
3).  Does not fit properly in your front pocket Due to its oversize.
4). Though it is made out of glass, it does not support wireless charging.
5).  Does not have 3.5 MM audio jack. You need to connect wireless through Bluetooth device or through type C wired headset."

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,Be ahead with OnePlus,Very very pro
OnePlus 7 Pro,5,"A Head Turner, A Show Stopper","Almond colour is a showstopper, OnePlus has indeed showcased their masterpiece in terms of overall built (perfection). The in-display fingerprint reader is insanely fast, in my opinion it's on par with traditional one's. Yes, the camera could use some work but I feel it's nothing an OTA can't fix (at least the hardware is strong to handle future fixes). The game changer for OnePlus is the DISPLAY, it is just gorgeous with QHD and 90hz panel (a visual treat indeed). Last but not the least, performance from the core chipset and the delivery by oxygen OS is right where you'd expect SUPERIOR. Gaming, scrolling through apps, movies, songs everything is just so different on OnePlus 7 pro. I really can't imagine going back to a regular 60hz panel anymore. Excellent job OnePlus, we are now a true Flagship Killer!!!"

OnePlus 7 Pro,4,Good. But not BEST,"Planning to buy OnePlus 7 Pro? Here's all in one review:
Bought OnePlus 7 Pro in first sale, now using it from few months.
Yeah! OnePlus 7 Pro priced little high.
PRO'S:
- OnePlus 7 Pro's DISPLAY looks damn beautiful with 6.67 inch OLED fluid Amoled 1440p display which has 90 Hz refresh rate.
- It comes with pre-applied screen protector.
- In display fingerprint sensor is faster than OnePlus 6T.
- Warp charger charges very fast, from 0-50 in just 20 minutes.
- In Fanatic mode, games can be played butter smooth.
- Can shoot video with 4k 30 fps with EIS, 4k 60 fps without EIS.
- Cam2api enabled.
- Snapdragon 855 gives best performance.
- Oxygen OS is BEAST, smooth, bloatware & ad-free, lag free.
- UFS 3.0 helps to improve performance.
CON'S:
- Though, display looks beautiful with 90 Hz refresh rate, but because of that battery drains much faster, as result give Screen on time 4-5 hours. You can change it to 60 Hz to save battery.
- Overpriced.
- Camera is not up to mark to call Flagship, it is just AVERAGE. It can't even focus on near objects.
- Device is heavy.
- No IP rating, but according to few, it survives in water as well, but not tested personally .
- No wireless charging.
- No headphone."

And when I contacted Amazon they are not helping me , they are asking to contact the manufacturer. After wasting this much amount on the top model phone of one plus, this is the reply that I'm getting from them.

Since it's a curved display & huge display with no notches on it you have to be a bit careful in handling it.

I used the phone for 3 days, and I have an 8GB Variant phone. Found the speed is decent, but at times it's getting stuck on few apps like Inst, WhatsApp, etc. The biggest drawback of this phone is its battery, For me, it's maxed giving me 10 hours of battery life whereas I am a moderate user. The camera is good but not great at this price range, you need to install Gcam to get some good picture, but honestly, that picture quality is also OK, not great."

How can you think that a baby company OP can even come closer to Sammy? It's better to go for a real flagship s10, instead of buying this called FLAGSHIP. Now a days s10 has lower price than this phone so it will be bad decision to buy this OP."

OnePlus 7 Pro,5,.,One of the best phone in market currently available ..batter life should be more according to the screen
OnePlus 7 Pro,1,Faulty device and irresponsible customer service,"Issue 1 : Phone freezes while using and then restarts.
Issue 2 : When someone calls nothing will show in the screen, if the phone is in vibration mode then it simply vibrates without showing anything and after couple of minutes it will restart and the call log will not show the called person details. Consider someone very important calls you and this situation occurs. I lost couple of my business deals because of this
Issue 3: While trying to unlocks it will freeze and then restarts
Visited customer service centre (80 km away from my home town) more than 5 times
1st visit : Without entering any case sheet, they told this is a software issue and flashed the device
2nd visit : Collected the device and after 6 days they return said motherboard has been replaced ( Have service summary ticket with me)
3rd visit : Entered another service ticket and after some days they cancelled the ticket (Have service ticket number with me)
4th visit : After begging them they entered another service ticket and now it is almost 8 days. In all these days I called their customer care almost 20+ times and sent emails more than 15 times and now they are saying they can't diagnose the issue so collect the device after 5 days and after that when issue occurs submit it again.
All these shows how irresponsible  and immature their service department is. Before buying this please consider you might also be one like me. Found couple of other users also reported the same issue."

Samsung Galaxy M30,3,Not upto any good,"This age samsung phones are nothing, when it comes to feel and user experience. The time the phone was first unboxed, the touch felt hard,but worked without error. Everything else good, camera clearer and real like, clearer than redmi phones, amoled also was ok, definitely amoled, but not very bright and colorful display. The back of phone also was over heating,I called up customer service, they said install all updates, it might change . But even after that, overheating is showing in the processor side and full screen ,when one game starts. The touch problem could not be solved completely, as this was not a appreciable error ,but only weak response and hard touch. I never felt like playing any game with such a touch and poor power behind the handset. Tried all touch repair apps from play store, and reset the phone also, but this never comes to a new phone touch feel. Terrible experience!! Even many China phones do more justice to everything. Samsung phones are only a name sake top notch."

Dont go for it  very unhappy of this product."
Samsung Galaxy M30,1,Bad,Bad
Samsung Galaxy M30,2,Pathetic phone.,"I made a mistake buying this mobile. So many told me not to buy Samsung mobile for its slowness and network issues, still I went ahead and bought it thinking by now Samsung quality would have bettered but nope. So many issues! First the mobile box had tampered, it looked like very old stock with dirty box. Then the box had only mobile and charger not even screen guard applied. Mobiles back is so plasticky and such a ugly looking! Only the amoled display is worth looking at. Finger print reader is so bad and slow, it takes a while to unlock or react. You doubt whether you properly kept the finger or not.
Is been 10 days and phone is ashtray slow. Screen gets hung when some app is open and you get a call. Also, it gets hung when you get a call and try to silence it by pressing start button. Sometimes you feel even touch isn't working but it's because the app reaction is slow in this mobile.
Good things I liked are amoled display, dark mode, customizations and some actions given to finger print reader like pulling down navigation bar."
Samsung Galaxy M30,5,Jani,Camera not so good at night time
Samsung Galaxy M30,3,Not satisfy,I have bay this mobile on 25 April 2019 & now the mobile start to hang.

Samsung Galaxy M30,3,Nice product,Very nice product with great features
Samsung Galaxy M30,1,Hanging and black screened mobile worst product,Mobile is hanging often and I see black screen
Samsung Galaxy M30,5,AN EXCELLENT OPTION -VERY GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY,"I recently bought a Galaxy M30 phone and I am fully satisfied with it. Thanks to the 6GB RAM, there is no perceptible delay in processing any command. Then there is the 128 GB Memory, which is more than a match for the videos which one gets very frequently on WhatsApp groups. The 5000 aAh battery enables it to run for two days without charging. Thanks to the C type charging cable, it gets fully charged in about an hour (earlier, I had to charge my phone each night, but sometimes I ran out of juice by evening).
Feature by feature, M30 is better than the J8 I was using earlier, but it cost me less than what I paid for J8 less than a year ago. M30 also compares quite well with the higher priced A50 which my nephew uses - the specifications are nearly identical, but the camera is superior in M30.
This phone is described as ""Made for India"" and Samsung seems to have done away with all the frills in terms of packaging - in other words, the box is quite flimsy. Apart from the handset itself, all you get is a data cable, a travel adaptor and an ejection pin - there are no earphones which used to be a standard accessory in earlier models. However, no compromises have been made in the specifications and the manufacturing quality of the phone itself.
On the whole, an excellent option for Samsung fans - the latest features and very good value for money too!"

Samsung Galaxy M30,5,Super,Excellent MOBILE and value for money
Samsung Galaxy M30,5,Don't buy it for camera,Nice buget phone camera not so good
Samsung Galaxy M30,3,Ok ok phone,"I bought this phone after using realme u1. The display is very good and the phone feels premium. I'm not much of a photographer so can't comment on camera. But the few picture I took seemed nice. Finger print sensor is painfully slow. It takes 3-4 seconds to unlock. On realme it used to be instantaneously. Overall the phone has a lower grade processor and the phone becomes too slow after a month of usage. I only use email, youtube, amazon and web browsing on phone. No gaming or any other heavy duty task.
Battery life is good with 5000 mAh and charging is a tad faster with 15W charger. Finally I sold the phone after 3 months of use."
Samsung Galaxy M30,4,"Best in ""this price range"" for watching Amazon prime videos and daily uses except games.","First, i don't play game.
Second, my primary purpose of buying this phone is watching web series and movies through Amazon Prime Videos and doind daily  normal uses.
In Highest quality there is a option to download videos through prime videos is 1.8Gb/hr but honestly it will download only lass than 1Gb data in highest quality. The best part is you can play Prime videos in whole screen like which is not able to play in Redmi Note 8, which is also a full hd display phone.
In realme 3 pro the maximum download quality option available is 2.3 Gb/hr, so it download better quality videos as compared  to Samsung galaxy M30 or Redmi Note 8.
If your purpose is not watching prime videos than go for Redmi 8, yes simply 8, which has the best battery backup i have ever experienced. Lasts for 2 day through intense use.
You can't compare the video quality through youtube or a video in your sd card ( videos will look approximately same in all these phones) but when you will start watching online contents (Amazon prime videos,  Netflix  etc) then there will be a major difference between these phones.
Samsung M30 Android 10 experience after updates is very smooth. You can uninstall majority of preinstalled apps like Google play music, movies, books etc which you can't do in Redme note 8 and Realme 3 pro. There will be many advertisements in the realme and redme in there pre installed apps which you can't uninstall or even disable,but not in Samsung M30.
For daily uses 3gb ram and 32gb memory of m30 is more than enough i didn't experience any lag or hang,works smoothly."

There is no changing indicator which is most important for me. NO indicator for calls and SMSs that my phone received. The Speaker is on the bottom side which is totally inconvenient. Sound quality is very poor.  The Sim tray is not suitable users like me. The Phone settings and other functions are totally very aukward and not easy and simple. I can't call by just clicking on saved no. There are so many drawbacks .

Samsung Galaxy M30,1,Not worth the money,"I bought this phone 3 months ago and in the beginning it was amazing. Great battery backup with good processing speeds. Then it slowed down with even the simplest tasks taking nearly 5 minutes to complete. Tasks like opening an app swiping between screens. Now it has stopped working completely. When you try to wake the phone up, nothing happens. If I am lucky then the back button will show up. Most of the time the display stays off. It is not even a primary phone so it doesn't have too many apps installed. Its just has a few basic apps installed.
I have a pixel 2xl which was bought 2 years ago and even now, it works just like it did on day 1 and it has 20 times the number of apps installed and is used A LOT.
Lesson learned that when it comes to a phone, don't but stuff that costs 10k or so. Spend a little more and buy quality stuff. This is the second time in 8 years that I have bought a Samsung phone and both times it has been full of problems. My advice to you is NOT to buy this one."

Samsung Galaxy M30,3,Review After 5 months,"I bought it mainly for it's Amoled display and I am happy with it.
Happy with the front camera
But not with the rare one.
Now coming towards the issues after using 5 months.
1. Phone become drastically slow and even hang sometimes although there is a lot of empty space and  unused RAM.
2 . It charges quickly thanks to fast charge , but it also drains kinda quickly.
3. Sometimes the fingerprint scanner is too irritating when it doesn't open."
Samsung Galaxy M30,2,Phone hangs all the time,"I hate Samsung phones period. I tried Samsung phone after gap of 4 years but nothing has changed. Samsung phone still hangs like hell. Every two days I have to restart device. When will samsung give up their bloatware. What ever customisation samsung is doing is not adding value. From now, stock android only ."
Samsung Galaxy M30,4,"Super, üòçüòçüòç",Good value for money
Samsung Galaxy M30,2,Issues after usage of 6months,"Mobile phone was working fine for first 6months but phone started to act weird after 6months usage. It started to respond slowly and then accessing applications/toggling between the application was almost impossible. It will act for few minutes better once you perform the optimize using device care but after that again it started troubling again. Tried resetting the phone, it worked for few days but didn't help either. I am yet to check with service center for these issue but disappointed with such low quality issues from branded product like Samsung."

Samsung Galaxy M30,4,Battery and camera wrost. Display quality nice. Mobile ok,Battery wrost
Samsung Galaxy M30,3,"Amazon -1, Samsung - yet to know","Thanks to Amazon for their fast delivery as always. I always find Amazon quite challenging themselves every day.
Comming to the handset it was a great to watch how samsung improved themselves from good for 1 year device company to a more budget category conscious company. These products really have good finish although very plastiky feel. In my case it was for my father-in-law who tries to keep himself updated with technology & his answer to that is in his hand.
Pros :
1. Good visibility, display.
2. Network support and VoWifi
3. Low on heat problem
4. Camera photography
5. Battery service
Cons :
1. Reponsivity
2. Sluggish in app drawing
3. RAM management
4. Un-installable apps
5. Native browser eats a chunk of battery.
That's how it was found. But all in all good mobile handset until we pass a year to find."

Samsung Galaxy M30,5,Worthy of the price!!! Great so far...,"I love the premium screen quality and the battery life of this phone. I have been a loyal Samsung user and this is with no doubt a good worthy mid ranger. Built wise I am a little off about the plastic make butg it does not feel that poor in look. The glossy back is however not fingerprint resistant so you will definitely need a good back case (good for phone case lovers). Thge fingerprint sensor is okayish, there is a little delay in response sometimes. As far as the operating system is concerned it is fine but again 'sometimes' there is heavy hanging. No heating issues so far and I really appreciate that about Samsung and also believe their low radiation emission is indeed true, shows concern for customers health. Gaming is average anyway I could satisfactorily play(not a heavy gamer though). Camera quality is just above average in low light settings but awesome in good and natural light setting. Speakers are fine too. So I guess I have covered all the basic stuff about the phone. Overall I love it and touchwood about the battery life... I am expecting a long battery lifeüòÖü§ûü§ûü§û"

Even when phone is not in charge it is showing as it is in charging. In center they have just formatted the mobile and returned me back. This is a worst experience for me.

Phone has some bugs. It automatically touches some button‚Ä¶closes and open by itself, while I am typing it will type something randomly ‚Ä¶not allowing me to type further. It feels like someone controlling my phone‚Ä¶I did restart first, and I did factory reset then also the problem didn‚Äôt solve‚Ä¶.. I went Samsung store to get it solved ‚Ä¶they also did software install and flashed it.
Even I did all the software update everything‚Ä¶but the problem didn‚Äôt solve‚Ä¶first I thought its only my phone doing like this‚Ä¶when I did online search there are many users getting this problem‚Ä¶
I request Samsung people to consider this issue‚Ä¶and I still have this problem I do have warranty also  I need replacement for this.."

Samsung Galaxy M30,1,Defective product from Samsung,It is a very bad purchase. Within 2 months the touchscreen has stopped working one day. I took it to the service center and the phone was returned without being repaired. The service center representative told me that there is a motherboard damage due to liquid spillage. There was no spillage of water or anything on the phone. Now I feel cheated because the customer service says that the repair is out of warranty because of the liquid damage and cost will be 13000 rupees. Samsung is clearly cheating customers if they are selling good for nothing mid range phones which won't even last for 2 months. This is my last and final buy from Samsung ever.

Samsung Galaxy M30,5,"Just Go for it! Great Phone,Value for money","If you are confused buying a new best budget phone, no more thinking just go for it...i was using a redmi note 7 pro for an year now...and i wanted a new phone...it was good but i wanted to update to a good one...and found some phones like redmi note 8 pro,  m30s, realme 5pro etc...my friend have redmi note 8pro and i use that phone often..its pretty similar to my old redmi note 7 pro...just bigger display and increased performance...but after looking this phones specs, i came to a conclusion that im buying m30s only...coz its offering a massive 6000mah battery which easily run about 2days after extreme use...the 48mp cam is great compared to 64mpcam in note8pro. Front cam is good..not that great if you are a selfie freak...this one also offer a samoled display at this price...The only cons i found was the Built Quality..i think this phone has a very low quality back panel made of plastic..a 200rs back case can solve that problem. I will update the review after using it for a long period."

Samsung Galaxy M30,2,Samsung m30 - dont buy at all,"This is a long term review. It's more than 6 months I have been using this phone
Pros: good battery life and the out of the box fast charger, an average user can last upto 2 days .
- Good camera , specially out door in sunlight.
- display quality good
- fingerprint sensor is good
Cons: very poor processor. Lags many times in simple operations
- face unlock is very slow
- the Android version used on this mobile is the worst as I see the basic feature of calling take 2 secs to initiate a call.
- backpanel is so delicate that it gets scratched very easily
- camera in video mode have no options like timelapse , boomerang etc
Overall dont buy this phone or Samsung phones at all
Overpriced and not worth it."

Samsung Galaxy M30,3,Samsung M30 - the true Samsung DNA,"Max to max 3 out of 5. I dislike Samsung but unluckily hTC and Huawei are facing headwinds and I was forced to buy this as I did not want to spend excessively on a phone. Apple, any type is bloody problematic and full of tantrums and has always been blue blondish in nature. Samsung as generally is, honeymoon's over within the first 1-2 months. Now battery drains out easily. Hangs though I have only a few banking and app cab apps along with redbud and irctc. Various types of tantrums have now become chalu though it's only about 4/5 months that I have been using it. Overall as expected from Samsung for a phone in this price range, ""Restart"" and ""God's grace"" should be your most important and favourite words during the tenure of such a phone's usage with continuos chanting of these as the phone gets older"

I have to reboot device in order to get it changed. One line, don't but, go with oneplus or redmi. If Samsung if your life, then go when top end devices, not basic device like this M30."

With these updates, the only drawback is my phone started to slow down. It was a UI update. Seems this last update in December was not meant for this phone. Samsung can improve more on their processor.
The camera quality is ok. Works good in natural lights, not so good in artificial lights.
The fast charger is quite good.

Samsung Galaxy M30,1,Worst performance,Worst phone ever
Samsung Galaxy M30,4,Pocket friendly budget mobile,"Bought thisnin november, but the price deop at the end of the sale was something i missed.
1. Battery: key selling point. So far jas lasted almost 2 days on a singlencharge with moderate to heavy usage of wifi, youtube videos and light gaming
2. Camera: excaptional in day lighy, out door and indoors.
Low.light photograpgy is not goodbat all. Evern with all the fancy stats about the camera,  pics are grainy and the camera striggles if flash is not used
3. Brilliant display but prone to scratches. Tje gorilla flass protects the top screen but yet i have scratches .. which almost seem below the top layer. Not happy at all with this.
4, no lag or slow down when gaming with asphalt or sim8lar games.
Overall, reliable budget mobile with amazing battery and display. To save battery i do reduce brightness in the evening and night."

Battery easily lasts more than one and a half day for moderate users. Have not played games on it. However, have been regularly watching Netflix and Hotstar, without any hearing issue of the battery. Camera quality is very good. Very fast fingerprint sensor and face detection to unlock the phone. Having hybrid memory card slot. Overall a good po package.
Overall best phone under 15 k
Wonderful phone. Value for money."
Samsung Galaxy M30,1,Disappoint with a,Toolkit as well as simcsrd slot is old and it's used not worth its damage product 0 ratings
Samsung Galaxy M30,5,SAMSUNG M30S,"Excellent, Improved product."
Samsung Galaxy M30,5,Best Super Amoled option that too from Samsung and most VFM out there,"Review for M30 -
Overall score ‚Äì VFM Paisa Vasool ‚Äì 9/10 ‚Äì Phone@Deal Price score 10/10
side by side compared with K20 pro OP 6 Nokia 5.1 Samsung A9 pro LG Q6
Screen ‚Äì 10/10 Super Amoled ‚Äì super ‚Äì side by side compared with K20 pro OP 6 Nokia 5.1 Samsung A9 pro LG Q6 ‚Äì Screen is 10/10 same like A9pro which too has super amoled, the brightness and the dark blacks are uncomparable, heck its even better OP and K20 which costed 4 times the price of this ‚Äì one word- outstanding ‚Äì no one can beat samsung here
Cameras ‚Äì 9/10 ‚Äì front 16mp and back triple cameras do good job, for 8K price they are close to other 15-16k phones easily, k20 pro cameras are better for sure, but when you view the picture on super amoled you see such sharp crisp images again credit to the screen than the cameras, in same screen when i sent k20 image it shone even more
build quality ‚Äì 9/10 ‚Äì for 8K price its good, front looks premium with small notch and looks same as any premium phones, back is flimsy plastic due to which point deducted, though many phones have plastic backs including much expensive ones
software ‚Äì 8/10, same samsung familiar UI software which is quite mature, has the regular samsung bloatware too, better than k20 but LG software is better and OP was best
cant complain much as its part of all samsung phones ‚Äì will not get much updates ‚Äì which i dont need anyhow.
performance ‚Äì 8/10 ‚Äì for 8k phone its great, doest lag in any work like browsing, videos, camera ‚Äì i dont anyway play games so cant comment but i am sure it will lag with heavy games, neither i need that nor the price says to include that.
Overall 9/10 but for Deal price of 8K its 10/10 considering the most impactful thing of a smartphone is screen and this is the best out there, other things are good too.
Am I happy with the purchase ‚Äì answer is a big yes, and great job by amazon to deliver it in 18 hours."
Samsung Galaxy M30,5,Best value phone,"Overall a very good phone. Things to like- battery life, screen, camera, quality of mobile. Things to dislike- nothing. Perticularly like the battery life. I think this mobile gives the best value for money."
Samsung Galaxy M30,4,G,Good
Samsung Galaxy M30,1,Interface and data privacy sucks,"The new interface and privacy on this device sucks, I believe Samsung and Google have decided to join hands and take all the data to monetize it and make millions. I really love apple, they are sensitive to such issues"

Samsung Galaxy M30,4,M30,"Satisfactory, not that good not that bad"
Samsung Galaxy M30,3,g,gzsdf
Samsung Galaxy M30,5,Great package at Rs. 10000.,"For the price (10k), it's an excellent bargain. Huge, 5000mAH battery, which easily lasts for 2 days under normal or even slightly heavier use, and with the fast charger provided, it gets full charge from about 2 to 21/2 hrs.
The Super Amoled display is brilliant. For a 10k rupee phone, it's simply out of the world.
My model is 3/32 (RAM & ROM). I find no memory issues though I have not used it for memory intensive things like gaming. You Tube videos played without any problems.
I'm not really satisfied with the image quality of the camera though but asking for more at this price point is perhaps a bit too much. It's focusing well in daylight but the colors are off quite a bit.
Sound quality is good.
Bluetooth is excellent. It is version 5.0 & has got AptX for fast streaming of Hi Res music files. This later fact is not highlighted in the specs given by the Samsung.
It has an FM radio which works well.
All in all, it's a great package at Rs. 10,000 & gives much more heft than one has paid for."
Samsung Galaxy M30,5,vv good,v good
Samsung Galaxy M30,1,SAMSUNG M30 STOPS ABRUPTLY,"Don't buy this product as I am suffering buying this product; suddenly the set is not responding, and I am unable to open the phone. This happens first time in my life. What a brand like Samsung doing !

Samsung Galaxy M30,4,Good asthetics but slow to use,"Plus points..
Excellent screen quality. And good screen resolution with very good body to screen ratio.
Battery life is very very good.
You can use it for full day with continues use on internet videos and games, and for normal use battery will stand for complete two days.
Minus points-
Slow processor.
Very bad and time lagging fingerprint reader. Phone unlock very slowly after applying fingerprint. It can not accept fingerprints easily. Partially wet fingers also not acceptable by fingerprint reader.
Camera quality is not much good. Only triple camera is a added benefit.
Conclusion-
For normal use it is very good to buy with excellent look and with long stand battery.
But if are looking for fast use and big games playing then you have to think on it."

Samsung Galaxy M30,4,Value For Money Product From Samsung with Android 10 OS Update,Value for money product. Screen to body ratio is not as good as M20. The PLS TFT display of M20 without the bluescreen filter is more brighter and clear when compared to sAMOLED of M30. M30 has got some interesting features like gesture screenshot and double tap wake up that M20 doesnot have. Touch is not so sensitive at bottom corners of M20 and M30. Camera is not good for shooting at night or low light but excellent at outdoors. Call quality with Jio Sim is good. Speakers are just ok. Battery drains fast during OS updation. No gorilla glass protection.

You didn't had to spoil your brand image just to enter low end phones market.
You have reduced the price but the processor is so slow that I feel I am using 10 years old mobile. Even displaying caller I'd will take 1 or 2 seconds.
Atleast MI phones work better in low end mobiles. This M30 you have just gave bigger battery but gave some m s dos level processor. Even after getting good deal in this mobile, I still feel its not worth. Seriously processor has to go"

I dislike the text keyboard in this phone model. Everytime when i type some text i am getting lots of text errors and if i press to text on 1 alphabet it's automatically taking other alphabet. Few times automatically phone is getting hanged and need to get re-start again.
The major and foremost thing i disliked is their is no slow motion video capture  option in this phone which i expected and really felt sad when i came to know this and no free head phones and additional tempered glass/gorilla glass given in the phone box.
Overall i can rate 6.5 out of 10 for this mobile."

Samsung Galaxy M30,5,About to be Divorced.,"I bought this for my 2 daughter who had kidnapped my wife's AND my phone everyday and refuses to give it until we threaten them with the police/indian army/indian airforce etc.
My married life was going to hell, my wife was irritated and frustrated, she was threatening with divorce. Everyday once we reach home our phones disappears and only appears once our daughters go to school in the morning. I had to check my mails in my laptop instead of my phone which is more convenient as well. Many days I leave office late so that I have my phone in my possession, and this was causing health problems for me.
I was on a crucial turining point in my life.
Then I saw this AD from Samsung. My life was about to change for ever.
I placed order and it was delivered in the same day.
And our life was reset. We were back to early days of our daughters who would happily ignore me and my wife's existence and just do thier own stuff without any troubles.
Once we bought this phone, we are leading a happy life. Our phones no more disappears, I can leave my phone on a table or sofa and goto toilet and come back with the phone being in the excat same place where I had left it.
It was bliss.
And I can check my mails in my own phone instead of laptop. My wife has also started loving me again, she dropped the idea of divorcing me.
We are only little happy family because of M30.
Ah about the phone, its a excellent phone, just go ahead and buy it."

3) My phone phone got shut down in 3 months and did not even hard reboot. I'm now heading to the service center to fix a new phone with hardware and software issues..

I have been using the mobile for a while and found that the camera is not working. Initially Facebook was not opening while trying to open from the notifications. I did not mind much and after the firmware update facebook issue got fixed and now when I press the camera app, it is not  responding at all.  I think this might be issue with the latest firmware I am currently in Oman and need to get this issue sorted by a Samsung authorized service technician in Oman and it is under warranty.
Please do the needful ASAP.

They are producing horrible photos. I think it's image processing is horrible. When I clicked first selfie and saw it I was just thinking what i have done, I spent money because of camera and I didn't get it. Only Display and battery life is good.

Samsung Galaxy M30,4,Bst ph on this budget,Great ph on this budget
Samsung Galaxy M30,1,Battery life is better,"I am writing this review after using the phone for 20 days approx.
First of all i will never suggest you to buy this phone if u use phone more than 6-8 hours a day.
After using xiaomi phones i thought i should try samsung bt it was my biggest mistake.
In few days only phone started hanging as i am a heavy user.
Fingerprint sensor also responds a bit later.
The camera quality is good for day shoot bt at night there is no night mode feature or low light feature so the quality becomes worst.
Yes the battery of this phone is better than any other phone in this budget and the charging system is also good as it provides type c with fast charging modes which charges the phone's 5000mh battery in 2 hours.
Another good thing is that we get amoled display in this mobile.
So, overall if we see if u r heavy user then plzz dont buy this phone or any low budget samsung phone and if u r normal user then u can try this else u will feel regret"

Samsung Galaxy M30,4,Good enough.,"I like the look of the phone . Display is good, camera quality is good enough for the price. I can't  say much of anything else since I'm not an expert on specs and I just bought it.
I do have one complaint though. This product doesn't include a silicone cover. My previous phones from other brands always had one silicone cover as well as a tempered glass included but I guess Samsung doesn't  do that."

Samsung Galaxy M30,5,"Marathon Battery, Camera Average to Good, Dispaly Maesmerizing","The main thing is Display which is too good. No other company can make AMOLED display like Samsung. It is fascinating.
And for that the 5000mah battery runs longer.Honestly speaking if you are a heavy user it will last for 12 hrs(it should ) or more and if you are a moderate to low user it will last for 1.5 days to 2.5 days, literally. Camera is not bad I would say good. Image stabilization is good night photography is also satisfying. Fingerprint is working fine may be a little bit like really little bit slow. Facelock is as usual nothing to worry. Type - c charges the phone with 15w charger in around 2 hrs from 20 to 100 approx.
I am satisfied."

Samsung Galaxy M30,5,You need to fix up all the necessary requirements before buying.,"Nice Phone, good for regular use. Colours are very good. Smooth functioning. Only drawback is it has plastic body and it doesn't give premium look. Typical HTC 816/820 feel. On the other side Nokia gives Snapdragon + Metal body at ‚Çπ10,000 in Nokia 6.1 plus. Other better options are there. Samsung if you are not a heavy user. You don't need 5000 mAh battery."
Samsung Galaxy M30,5,Best value for money,"I bought this phone a week back. It is the best Samsung 4g mobile under Rs.10000. Very clear 16 MP front selfie camera. Good working face detection lock. light weight phone with sleek design. Battery back up is excellent with fast Type-C charger. Quick charging and long lasting battery. Speaker has low volume, however it is good enough to watch YouTube or listen to music and calls. (This product does not come with a head phone or lead) My overall rating of this product is... the best value for money. Without having a second thought you can buy."

Samsung Galaxy M30,5,Power packed features in budget segment,"With this online only Samsung M series, you get some good features without going hard on your pocket. SAmoled screen and 5000 Mah battery are the stars for your purchase. Instead of talking the pros or cons lets wrap this beauty with the following specs:
1. SAMOLED display is the best you get in this price segment
2. Battery is exceptionally good with the specs, favoring you for 1.5 or 2 days according to the usage
3. Camera takes some good pictures with wide angle winning your purchase
4. Chipset will work as butter for normal usage and for gaming with low n medium graphics, may heat up though
5. 4/64 GB dont any clarification
6. Look may disappoint some with plastic build but better then many glass or steel phone, sheer beauty
7. There is no 4k videos with standard camera application but can be done with 3rd party applications, not an issue at all
8. Fingerprint sensor is on a slower side comparing other, but not an ice breaker
Yes, you can get a better looking Samsung A50s with going hard on your pocket giving you some high end features, but this is no disappointment. And somehow the only thing is that sabse bada rupaiya for many, so hop-on."
Samsung Galaxy M30,1,Camera,Camera not in expected level
Samsung Galaxy M30,4,Feedback about M30s,M30s battery is super awesome but it takes almost 2 hour to complete charge.most of the phones in this segment claims face unlock but they didn't work properly even I've used many but M30s face unlock works even in low light also.camera quality is good.if you want to purchase any mobile under 15k.please go for it.you won't feel regret after using this phone.

Camera is Average,
Display is good,
Battery performance is Average
Performance is poor.
Phone hangs a lot when battery is less than 15%, it's impossible to operate at these battery levels, There are a lot of os/software issues in Nokia smartphones, Ex: alarm will not stop buzzing even when you stop it, you'll have to restart the phone to stop noise, At times your phone would be ringing, but you'll not see anything on screen, My phone's charging socket became unfunctional after 8 months of purchase, had to get that fixed, after 11 months of usage, phone would automatically power off every 10-15 minutes, even when there was no activity, went to service center, they were unable to help and had to format my phone to see if that fixed problem, but it didn't, then after 2 weeks it was working normally, my friend purchased Nokia 8.1 and he has same complaints, Should have gone for Samsung or other smartphone, they are better in the same price range."

I bought Nokia with my old trust in this brand but now admitting the truth,I would say that Nokia people and technology is left far behind."
Nokia 7.1,1,Worst phone,This is the worst phone i ever purchased.. i never expected this from Nokia.. it hangs for no reason.. we cant do multi tasking with this phone.. sometimes call gets on hold while we talking cause call sensors are not active to keep my display sleep.. over all this is the worst phone. And amzone is selling this for no refund policy .. and that's another smart move to sell products though we don't like....
Nokia 7.1,5,Gud,Nyc one
Nokia 7.1,4,Great phone with great display,"In this price range this mobile is far better than Mi A3, i used A also but fingerprint lock, screen resolution, design is way better than any other phone in this price range.

2. Camera seems like it needs lot of calibrations to get the picture quality u want.
3. Doesn't hav some features like advance calculator, merging duplicate contacts, compass etc. You just need to adjust with default options and apps.

Nokia 7.1,2,Worst phone experience,Hardware is excellent. Crispier images with Zeiss lens. Good battery backup. But the filing system is really messed up. You can't locate your WhatsApp images properly. It's easier to locate a needle in a haystack than to locate recent WhatsApp image you received. Unlike Samsung or Xiaomi Nokia doesn't has any supporting apps. Nokia phones entirely are dependent on Android based third-party software to manage files. Worst experience using a phone ever. You would get better phones in lesser cost. Would not recommend this phone.

Nokia 7.1,4,Nokia 7.1 is an very good smartphone with reliable hardware n performance,"After using 5 days, my experience with phone is that it's very good product from hmd company.For an average user, it is top smartphone with reliable performance and build quality.Phone battery backup lasting around 30 hrs after normal use. One issue with phone that it's getting more warmer after 40- 45 min use.Hmd should resolve this issue with top priority."
Nokia 7.1,4,An Amazing Smartphone. Nokia has again proved its mettle. Nokia ROCKS,"***An excellent smartphone at this price point.
***Camera is very capable. f/1.8 aperture is very bright  and live Bokeh mode is just awesome.
***Install Google Camera and just see the magic. The Dynamic range is super excellent and the Night Sight mode works like a charm. Now Google Camera 7.0 is also compatible with this device.
***Above all the craziest thing is it's Enhanced HDR 10 display. Very much comparable to the the phones having amoled panels.
***As a part of the Android One initiative, updates are seamless. I am already on the October 2019 Security patch and Android 10 is arriving very soon. Go with the Stock Android even other smartphones with tons of extra features are not providing timely updates. So if u are purchasing a phone then you should be bothered about updates also. With the Stock Android, u can feel the update.
***I am not mentioning the cons specifically because every smartphone has flaws with them. No smartphone is perfect.
***But if anyone is a die hard fan of NOKIA and he/she is planning to buy any smartphone within the price bracket of 12000, go with this phone.
***Guys it's NOKIA!!! Super Premium looking smartphone. U can easily avail extra discount if u use any debit card or buy this phone with exchange. I got it for 8700."
Nokia 7.1,4,Pesa vasool for papa phone,Good mobile
Nokia 7.1,4,Average buy,Camera quality is not up to the mark.
Nokia 7.1,2,Nokia 7. 1 poor performance,Nokia 7.1 is a poor choice.. Please stick to better brands. Sound quality is poor and feels cheap in the hands. You cannot reshuffle home button. Make in India not good enough. Avoid. Big mistake made by me.
Nokia 7.1,2,Processor slow,Processor Very slow restart very day very bad phn Nokia
Nokia 7.1,5,Nokia come out from your comfort zone,Battery and processor could have been better....Nokia should have given 3500 mah battery and SD 660 in this price segment to capture the market share and to compete with Chinese giants.
Nokia 7.1,4,Its good product in its price.,It has some touch issues.. some times it heats.. camera is awesome.. battery life is not so good for heavy user..
Nokia 7.1,2,Dont go for Nokia,"There are many alternates available at the Nokia 7.1 price range. 7.1 is not worth its price. Having used it for 8 months, it doesn't have any stand out feature. Also, within 8 months the faulty charging ports need to be changed. This problem is a recurring issue with Nokia phones. A lot of complaints are there in the net about the issue. Overall dont go for Nokia smartphones. The service centers are also not very good."
Nokia 7.1,2,very bad product -touch screen,touch screen is not very effective.Camera/voice quality very bad.I will not advice to purchase this product.I want to return the product.
Nokia 7.1,5,Good,Good phone in this price range
Nokia 7.1,1,Very poor battery performance and software,Battery quality is very poor. It's not working after 4 months of use. Pathetic battery performance and software.
Nokia 7.1,5,It's Ok,"Not a bad product , Battery life is not so good,"
Nokia 7.1,5,Replacemet,"The earphone on trying tdy after purchase,  cud observe that it is defective and not working.  Need replacement.  Inv.no. HR-DEL2-146160011-1920
Dtd. 25.9.2019.99"
Nokia 7.1,1,Not good,"Nokia is no more Nokia, reboot time is more than 10 mins, gets hangs some times , atleast once a day, I would not recommend."
Nokia 7.1,4,Good buy,"Nokia 7.1 does what it says. It's earlier price which was around 24000 rupees was way too much, but now with around 12000 rupees you get just right for your price. Talking about the phone it's camera is just outstanding. Even though it has only a 12 MP and 5 MP combination the Zeiss optical do their job and make the photos shot even better. When compared to the Mi phones, Nokia 7.1 is way better than the Note 5 pro or Note 6 pro with it's Gorilla glass (curved) 3. Even the photos shot with Nokia are better than the note 5 pro or Note 6 pro.
With the 4 GB ram you can absolutely do the everyday work finely but if you are more into the Gaming world, I would suggest you to find a better option. The 64 gigs of storage is just fine as you can keep a lot of files, some games, couple of movies and some songs with you with no storage lag. Talking about the battery, it lasts fora day when used moderately. But with heavy usage your phone might drain away all of it's battery with 9 to 10 hours which is pretty ok. The finger print sensor is the thing which holds the phone back, using the sensor you might encounter with a  lag which is for not more than a second and a half(sometimes even 2). Overall the phone is a good choice if you are a both a fan of pure android (stock) and are a bit tight on your budget."

Nokia 7.1,3,Good value for money. Could be a bit more robust for charging.,"Didn't realise the battery life. Three to four hours of normal usage. Heavy phone, but I guess that's a compromise. The charge point socket is not working properly. The original wire stopped charging in two months. And then ith other cables fast charging does not work well. But value for money. Wondering if I can get it checked or replaced after about 6 months."

Nokia 7.1,1,"Bad Service, threw in dustbin within 6 months","If any problem arises, the authorised service centre will not resolve it. There is only one authorised service centre in a City like Hyderabad. And the service is not good.

So i was forced to locally service my phone! So, dont buy Nokia phones considering the fact that nokia doesnt provide us with excellent services and solution for our problems!"

Nokia 7.1,5,Value for money,Sound quality
Nokia 7.1,5,Beautiful Phone! Must to consider at 12k price point!!!,"Beautiful perimum look phone! In 12k price point it's a must consider phone. You can easily see the difference between Mi, Vivo, poco etc.., and Nokia phone in this price point.

Nokia 7.1,4,Worth of Buying,"Excellent Phone, sturdy, rigid"
Nokia 7.1,2,Need to update,Not working properly.
Nokia 7.1,3,Post 6 months review,"Posting this review after using for 6 months.
Points
1. Price dropped drastically 35% in 6 months from my date of purchase. It is worth at current 13k price now.
2. Excellent for a normal day-to-day use which involves only calling or whatsapp and using other apps.
3. Design is very nice but body is too slippery
4. Keypad typing is not so friendly
5. Camera is ordinary
6. Battery life is good
7. Fingerprint reader works every-time and is quick to respond
8. Have been playing PUBG on this mobile it works fine and can easily play but on average graphics. However I do not recommend for PUBG players as it misses touch while in a game.
9. I personally prefer and support Make In India brands and Nokia being a reputed brand went for it.
Conclusion: If planning to use it only for normal usage this phone is good and very fast as it comes with stock Android (Android One)"

Nokia 7.1,1,The worst phone ever.,"The worst of android phones. Nokia's hardware is not supporting android at all. It strucks and hangs like crazy.. very unfriendly.. the flinger printer is the worst of worst. It doesn't unlock quickly and it doesn't even respond properly to the user actions. But it automaticallh tries to unlock when it's jn pocket and annoys us like hell. Inspite of Snapdragon 845, which is kind of successful with other phones is still not worth with this hardware.

Nokia 7.1,5,Underrated gem in the current lines of Nokia Smartphones.,"When you are Looking for a phone which have stock OS, better build, display and camera quality of the lot there are not that many options. You either go for Nokia Motorola phones or pixels with few exceptions of Xiaomi android one initiative.
Nokia 7.1 shines in around 15000 ‚Çπ segments. It has body of aluminium 6000 series metal that gives the phone premium look with strong build.
Stock OS with Android one programme which offers  2 years of major OS upgrade and 3 years of security patch updates from the launch date. Phone was launched in October 2018 so  you are insured till October 2021.
Display is another feather in this remarkable phone cap. HDR10 compliance and 432 ppi makes it best IPS display in under 15000‚Çπ.
Primary camera with 12 MP and f/1.8 aperture takes better photos with above average dynamic range in the lot. It supports 4K with gyro-EIS. In Portraits edge detection is excellent. Secondary camera is 8 MP with f/2.0 aperture is better though not the best.
Battery is 3060 maH. So you can't expect to do it wonders when you have high quality display. On average with general usage it lasts a day. It comes with 18W charger. Which takes 1 and 1/2 hrs to charge it 0 to around 90 percent.
Now Issues/misconceptions.
1. Heating- Yes. It does heat though its basic when you use internet while charging, playing games with higher graphic settings etc . When the battery is sandwiched between  two metal plate. It tends to heat bit more than other plastic phones.
2. Performance - It's 636 Snapdragon. 'Midrange of Snapdragons' performance is supposed to be average.
Conclusion- If you are looking for the phone for day to day tasks with consistent performance in around 15000‚Çπ segment. It's the best choice."
Nokia 7.1,5,Excellent!,"I was looking for phone with Good Battery backup, no Bloatware and Good call clarity.

Nokia 7.1,1,Farzi. Don't buy it,Garbage product
Nokia 7.1,3,Sluggish,Just ok
Nokia 7.1,1,It's a paper weight,Just days after purchase there were problems with network. Flipkart said it can not be exchanged and have to download app which will tell whether there is problem with phone or not. According to app phone is good. It's horrible... Don't buy this phone.. now it's not getting charged just after 2 months. It's RS 18000 paper weight..
Nokia 7.1,1,"Don't buy this mobile, you will regret for sure-""Switched OFF and Battery Drain Issue""",Phone got switched off the next day of purchase I had to reboot it. Camera hangs always .Every time have to restart the phone to make one or the other apps to work.i have to wait one week to get appointment with the technician. First they told to factory reset it and even after doing that still it persists will replace.when I called Amazon after factory reset and still facing problem they told technician will come and check and then with his approval only I will get replacement.and I have to wait one week to get appointment.
Nokia 7.1,5,Mast hi,Kamal
Nokia 7.1,1,ITS A BIG NO!,The phone is okay as per its price but the after sales service of Nokia is worst. Mostly the spare parts are not available in Nokia care and they would charge you half of the phone price if the phones touch doesn‚Äôt works.Besides it‚Äôs design is not for daily use as the back of the phone has a glass and if your phone gets dropped that black glass would easily break and hamper the look of the phone. To replace the back glass they would charge you 1200bucks and may be more depending on the availability of spare parts. STRONGLY RECOMMEND NOT TO BUY THIS!
Nokia 7.1,3,Need to improve Nokia,"At this point of range need fast charging support
Also sometime phone lags"
Nokia 7.1,4,WORTH IT!!,Nice prouduct.
Nokia 7.1,1,Not the same product as it is displayed on the Amazons website,Not the same product as it is displayed on the Amazons website.
Nokia 7.1,5,Best,Overall phone is quite good in this segment especially the camera is unbeatable but there is one issue with battery backup
Nokia 7.1,5,Darun,Darun
Nokia 7.1,1,Worst phone ever,Worst phone ever....bought a month back and being to service center twice. Waste of money
Nokia 7.1,2,Mobile Handset is hanged and went into Download more with in 3 months of Purchasde,Handset went into Download Mode when swithed on after getting down flight. Not able to operate. Purchaes thro Amazone on 13.02.2019. Visited Nokia Care Centre at Baroda while on tour. But could not get repaied. Handset is not trust worthy.
Nokia 7.1,4,Gud,"I don't know about negative comments.
What I fell is above average phone what more can u expect from midrange phone.
Its main point is camera which is very good .
Software : 9/10
Display : 8/10 its ok ips panel very bright.
Battery : 8/10 update it to pie. Its good for 3000 mah.
Sound : 10/10 I really like it.
Performance : 10/10 stock android . Cool
It has zeiss optics very good cameras,wide angle front cam .
If you like Nokia then at current price its awesome now ."
Nokia 7.1,1,Pls don‚Äôt buy,"Do not waste the money by buying the phone. Its battery is not good backup is not good , Sensor does not work at all."
Nokia 7.1,5,Beautiful Beast at this price!,"Writing this review after 2 weeks of usage.
1)Design- God, this phone is slim and built like a tank. The phone has a really premium feel (without any cover on) in bare hands. And I never get tired of getting compliments about the glass back. Whoever sees it just goes wow.Overall great design, just one con is the quite bug chin.[5/5]
2)Software - This mobile comes with Android one program. I doubt I need to say anything else in this segment.[5/5]
3) Performance - I admit snapdragon 636 is a let down at this price segment considering the latest market trends, but it works just fine without any lags. I bet PUBG would run pretty smooth,I haven't tested it myself (mobile gaming is not my thing). Normal small games like Subway surfers, Temple Run work smooth. [4.8/5]
4)Camera - I actually was regretting my decision to stick with the nokia 7.1 instead of going with the nokia 8.1 but as soon as this beauty arrived, I was blown away by the cameras.
The sheer amount of details and colours it caprures along with high dynamic range just makes it the camera king of this sub 16k segment. Realme 3 pro(which belongs to my friend) fails straight away as I compared it with the Nokia 7.1, can't say anything about the note 7 pro, I didn't get the chance to compare one. If you're looking for a brilliant camera, this baby kills it.[5/5]
5) Speakers- I was quite surprised by the speaker quality, though these are not the best in its segment, they deliver quite high trebles and mediocre bass, earphones recommended[4.3/5]
6) Screen - The HDR 10 support works like a charm. The display is crisp, sharp and overall beautiful [4.8/5]
7)Sensors - The adaptive brightness works like a charm, you'll never need to bother about your screen brightness , except for a few times. The fingerprint sensor is decent, but I've seen faster working fingerprint sensors, it does the work pretty well. Unfortunately, I've got no info on the face unlocking (not a big fan) Overall, they are quite good.[4.5/5]
8)Battery - 3060 mAh battery does fall a bit short, but runs through a day easily, I'm a medium user who scrolls Seocial media ,listens to music, watches few youtube videos. The fast charger bundled in the box blazes this phone from 40-80 in like 20-25 mins(might be a deciding factor for you).[4.4/5]
If you're looking for a camera beast with slick UI , look no further. At this sub 16k price point, this is a steal."
Nokia 7.1,3,3.5 mm headphone jack and charging port issues. Any one came across that ?,"Overall good, in the beginning of purchase, the phone restart after when an app Mal functions. But later it is almost fixed with a firmware update. Now the issues is with the hardware. The 3.5 mm headphone jack won't fit any brand of headphone after using it for about 4-5 months. I was a huge fan of nokia's premium build quality. Currently, the story says something else. Nokia must still toil hard in its build quality. I wasn't expecting that from Nokia."

Nokia 7.1,4,Nice,Ok nice mobile
Nokia 7.1,4,The best budget phone but with some minor flaws,"This is a honest unbiased review of Nokia 7.1
I received nokia 7.1 and the moment I hold it, it felt premium!
Pros:
1. HDR display is the best feature , which is
hard to find in even a higher midrange
phone
2. Rear camera quality is superb in daylight
and outdoors, portraits look great, bothie
mode is a fun feature to try. Nokia
camera app is great, videos at 1080p are
great but some disturbances are noticed
when recording at 4k.Carl Zeiss optics
does the job right.
3. Premium build is one of the best selling
point of this phone, believe me after
holding this you will feel like you have
bought a more costlier phone. Phone is
all glass held by a aluminum frame cut
from single block, perfectly engineered
edges and silvery finish (or copper) feel
lot more premium.
4. Stock android is another feature this
phone boasts , with 2 years of os upgrade
and 3 years of security updates this
phone ensures a long lasting clutter free
android experience.
Cons:
1. heating is a major issue , the phone heats
up quickly, but can be resolved by
Installing the security patch and soft
reset.
2. Small battery size is another major con,
the battery only lasts a day , with medium
to higher use at 55% brightness.
3. Above Average processor, only for casual
gamers.
4. Average selfie camera performance and
average low light performance.
So , overall experience was good with this product,  mainly the design, camera, display and software were amazing but the performance was above average
You could play high end games but not for hours, since you could notice some frame drops after 3 hours of playing.
I suggest this phone for those who want a superior display, outstanding design, build quality, and a above average gaming performance."
Nokia 7.1,5,Only Verified Purchased,Amazon please only display verified purchased people out here and i m watching some people making Nokia brand down without even purchasing the product ! How is this possible?
Nokia 7.1,1,Worst,I dont like the phone and there is no specific feature in this phone
Nokia 7.1,4,Nokia 7.1,Phone look is nice..but sometimes time charging issue.... bottom side display show something like screen damage effects.....
Nokia 7.1,2,Battery life,Battery is not good
Nokia 7.1,1,Average,Call dropped during call.
Nokia 7.1,4,Good for social media usage but poor camera pics in low light,"Screen display is great. Battery life is good. If you use social media like Facebook Twitter Instagram throughout day then around 40% battery is still available.
Camera during day light gives amazing pics but pics during night light is very bad, you can see grains in the pic. There's a pro mode though in which you can  adjust ISO, Shutter speed, White balance but it's not very impressive."

Nokia 7.1,4,Nice,Nice but costly
Nokia 7.1,5,Brilliant mobile for photography,"The Carl zeis camera optic has made crystal clear photos even in dim lights.
The phones capability is beyond other rivals. The mobile is Handy and for to Palm size. Ease of access across the screen. You would love it"
Nokia 7.1,5,Nice phone,"Nice design and best display phone,"
Nokia 7.1,5,"If you want quality and don't mind spending a but more, its the best choice!!","Specs never say the full story, the user experience is what matters!!
The quality they have brought in each and every aspect of the phone is just amazing!!!
Build quality - top notch. No scratches in 2 months while using it without any case or glass. And did i mention that i dropped it too a couple of times??
Display - HDR 10 display is the best in class. Only phone to offer thay under 20k.
Software - Buttery smooth in every way. No jitters at all. And specially, NO ADS like MI and Samsung phones.
Camera - You will be surprised what Zeiss optics can do!!! Best under 20k."
Nokia 7.1,4,Good Classy Phone from Nokia  for the price,"Nokia has produced an excellent premium quality mobile which offers a good value for money. I purchased the Steel colour mobile directly for myself  from the Nokia site for Rs. 15,400/- on a promo offer  approx a month ago.  It looks very premium & feels like a phone in the range of 35K to 40K.
Pros
1) Looks very premium & better than the shown image .
2) Excellent vibrant display which is better  than most of the expensive phones out there.
3) Decent Battery. I have read a lot of people commenting on battery issues. I am a moderate user & occasionally watch Youtube . I don't see films on the mobile nor am I a gamer. I use the mobile for making/receiving calls & whatsapp primarily. On an average it gives me 1.5 days & maximum 2 days. I don't charge everyday. I use it on battery saver mode & keep my phone brightness at 40% which is good enough with vibration & touch key feedback off. Also dosen't heat up while charging & chrages decently fast.
4) The photos are quite good as compared to my earlier phone. For the avid photographer there is a pro mode with more flexibility.
5) Video has slow motion ( Not sure may be 50 fps).
6)Stock Android without any bloatware
7) Good incoming sound quality & loud speaker sound
8 )The fingerprint sensor works smoothly.
Cons
1) It has a glass back which may break if it falls down or prone to scratches. Hence requires a cover (Black Golden sand cover looks very good & premium for the Nokia 7.1).
2) After many updates sometimes you feel there is a slight lag  when browsing through the phone. Hence wished it had a faster processor although the current one does its job.
3) The auto-rotate feature could have been more predictable which I find an issue with most phones.
4) Double tap on the screen many times does not wake up the phone.
All in all a very good phone from Nokia & would definitely recommend it over the  Chinese ones. Infact have purchased the blue colour variant for my family member from Amazon .
On both the phones I have not seen serious heating up issues of the phone & poor battery issues as some have mentioned in the day to day normal usage.  Its a classic come back for Nokia."
Nokia 7.1,3,Not bad,Heating phone not like very much
Nokia 7.1,2,Pathetic experience. Worst choice I made by buying this phone.,"I had a pathetic experience this time. Nokia has really let me down. This phone has a big time battery issue. It has a hell lot of heating issue. While charging a notification pops up ""the temperature is outside the acceptable range stop charging!"" WTF. Really disappointed."
Nokia 7.1,5,Love it,Very good product from Nokia this time. Built quality is just great and it feels so premium.
Nokia 7.1,1,It heats & hangs,"It ""heats"" too much even on airplane mode while ""charging"", ""hangs"" occasionally but that's something irritating, heating problem can be observed while simple use that too without
Charging"
Nokia 7.1,5,Best Premium feel smartphone in the midrange segment.,It has a Premium body design and is a great camera phone because of its Zeiss Lens. It has a very immersive display experience as it supports HDR10. The OZO feature for video is amazing. The android one feels crazy smooth and snappy on this device.But sometimes(rare case) the phone restarts automatically on which the Nokia is expected to provide an update.
Nokia 7.1,1,Too low sound.. Not recommended,Too low sound.. Not recommended
Nokia 7.1,4,Bad charger quality,Sorry nokia i really loved ur product but again u have disappointed with ur phone.in just 3 month my charges has stop working and charger connector  also get damaged so when I have visited to service centre I  found 8 out of 10 issues were related phones charger connector.

Nokia 7.1,3,Good phone for under 15k,"An all rounder phone. Good camera and screen. Everything else is average. Sometimes feels sluggish even though I don't have a lot of apps installed. Bought it for 17k+, now it's under 15k, so worth it now."

Nokia 7.1,4,Price is too high,"Camera quality is not upto the mark which i expected from Nokia, battery life is very poor, 2times charge is needed for using daily stuff"
Nokia 7.1,4,Value for money,"The mobile is good looking and super shiny.
The phone body is super glossy which also require protection from scratch.
The display pixel density is super awesome. The camera is good but not that great given it is from Zeiss which raises the bar for expectation.
Gives a full day battery with regular usage with Bluetooth WiFi 4g on full day."

Nokia 7.1,1,Useless phone..... Hanging issues are there.... Don't even think to buy this phone,Don't waste your money on it
Nokia 7.1,5,Best in NOKIA,"One of the best phone I have ever used. Nokia has been able to maintain its quality and durability. Holding this phone in your hand will give you an iPhone experience. Best things is Google lens. Phone runs very smooth.
I am very satisfied with this phone, only pricing is little bit high in comparison to other smartphones of same features.
Keep going on Nokia."
Nokia 7.1,1,Bad phone,"I bought this mobile from Amazon on 5th May. It is not even a month and the phone has started showing problems. It gets heated up, apps automatically turn off while using, touch around corners does not work. Never buying Nokia again
You've made crass of a huge brand"
Nokia 7.1,1,Worst,"Within 20 days. Software issue, phone been to download mode and booting. Seems i need to visit Nokia care. Now i feel i dont need this phone."
Nokia 7.1,5,Nokia rocxx,One of the best phone after Nokia 8.
Nokia 7.1,1,Worst customer support,"Bought a Nokia 7 plus 9 months before. A few months later, the phone started showing some problems with charging. Eventually the charging port became loose and I was unable to charge the phone. I gave my phone to a Nokia service centre on May 6th. It's been one month. The service center told me that there is a shortage of spare parts. I have been contacting Nokia customer support almost everyday for the past one week. Now they are telling me that even they don't know when the problem will get resolved.
Today i have registered a complaint with National Consumer Helpline. I don't understand why Nokia can't provide parts for a mobile which is launched less than a year ago.
They are launching new models after another but couldn't provide support for the customers.
Now I will think twice before buying Nokia products.
Really pathetic product and customer support."

Premium designer..
Looking cool with corners ..
Heating issue ...
Lag some times .."
Nokia 7.1,2,"lags, very bad battery, heated as hell,","one of the most stupid decision i made to waste 20k on this device. i mesmerized on looks and nokia branding but forgot this is not that older Nokia. from day one i faced heating issues while charging the device. believe me fast charging is not really so fast as it should have been. screen is good, UI is quite good as it supports android one.
its really funny my phone was hanged at the time of inserting sim at very first time wow. In low battery it started getting lag.
now it is for 16k in market
so if you are planning to purchase it pls dont. if money is really important for you than invest wisely.
thanking you."
Nokia 7.1,4,Smart,Good
Nokia 7.1,5,Nice product,Nice phone little bit camera not as expected rest all is ok and awesome.
Nokia 7.1,4,Good for the price,The sound quality is exceptional
Nokia 7.1,4,Front Camera,Front camera is not gud...not for selfie lover ..
Nokia 7.1,4,Good,Good
Nokia 7.1,4,Average phone but expensive according to price,Hangs after one month camera is not as good
Nokia 7.1,1,Very nice mobile for 1990,Should have sold 10 years ago...sorry big-NO to kia
Nokia 7.1,4,Good phone well engineered ... but for the charging port :(,"Phones with metal bodies are well engineered. (have to be well engineered due to the wireless nature)
Further more phones with metal bodies tend to warm up but also cool down pretty quickly. They dessipate the heat pretty quickly as compared to phones with plastic bodies. Hence due to better heat dessipation they tend to last longer and are less susceptible to hardware failures.
Nokia should have included cover for this phone with the package...keeping with their traditions.
The camera takes descent pictures, however a little upgrade to the camera software is expected as zoom in zoom out features do not work in all the modes.
After using the phone for a few calls lasting more than 40 mins i could sense that the SAR levels are low and do not give you a burning feeling.
After all the positives came the bitter negative in a few weeks of use.... this model has a design flaw in the charging port. The C type connector makes a very delicate connection. My phone is not able charge with the charger. It only charges on a USB port of my computer. Further more it is unable to communicate over USB !!
Nokia is losing or has already lost it's reputation of quality :("
Nokia 7.1,3,Cool,"Camera quality good,  but battery life is very bad"
Nokia 7.1,5,Value for Money,"Perfect phone in mid-range. Pure/stock Android, Pie 9 software, Stylish Look, Zeiss lens, good battery backup fr heavy user, No heating issue, Type C port, great & loud music/speaker. what else you need?"
Nokia 7.1,5,Must purchase,The phone was very nice really loved it!!
Nokia 7.1,2,A deal breaker as the battery life and the charging time required are not satisfactory.,"I have used this phone for over three months now and I am not at all satisfied with battery life of this product. The battery drains very quickly and it wouldn't have been much of a problem for me unless its charging time was also an issue. It takes about 2hrs for a full charge(or even more probably as it certainly fells like an eternity) even though nokia  sells this product advertising the mobile's fast charging capability(which is a scam for sure). In the beginning I thought that there might be some problem with my charger or probably with the phone but I made sure that neither of them were the problem. Except these 2 issues I guess this phone is satisfactory but the battery issue bugs me a lot and is certainly a deal breaker from my point of view.
PS : I'm not the kind of person who reviews products on online platforms. This phone was such a disappointment for me and I don't want other people to fall in the trap of fast charging which Nokia has so conveniently advertised."
Nokia 7.1,5,Yes,Good clear sound ....and its loud to enjoy every types of music ....bass is also good..good price.price segment its good.....
Nokia 7.1,1,Very bad nokia,"Total waste, the phone is very heavy heating,and the Nokia service centre is waste and not responsible,please Amazon team help me"
Nokia 7.1,3,Nokia 7.1 version.,The Nokia phone I perchased on April 3rd.but nowadays it's keyboard isn't working properly.so I need the solution.ad early as possible.
Nokia 7.1,4,Review  after 3 months of uses.!,"A good package overall. Good camera, Average Battery life, Best in class display. Software is butter smooth, Monthly updates are satisfactory. If you are on a tight budget and want a trusted brand you can go from this. Or consider Nokia 8.1"
Nokia 7.1,5,Love üíñ,Nice
Nokia 7.1,1,"not worth it, PERIOD!!",Product certainly doesn't stand up to the durable nokia phone which we all know this brand for. To make things worst after 3 moths my cell started showing problem while charging and the service center guys are not helpfull and certainly dont fall back in using all the possible loopholes when i took my phone for repair
Nokia 7.1,1,baddest phone i have ever use,"i bought this one it stopped working two times in two months ..
and i requested to get a replacement but i didn‚Äôt get
i just got repair service from nokia
there are so many problems in this phone
i just waste my money
nokia is no more trustable brand..."
Nokia 7.1,1,Bad product,Received a broken item.üò°üò°üò°üò°
Nokia 7.1,1,Snapdragon Qualcomm? Does it exist in this phone?,Phone sucks with the heat that it generates while opening any app
Nokia 7.1,4,Good Product !,"It is indeed good product, atleast i can say it is better than other chinese mobile available in the market."
Nokia 7.1,5,Outstand Phone,The gadget is outstanding with gorgeous look specially from back side as it is completely glass and it shines in night which gives tremendous look. Coming to camera quality rear camera is awesome however front camera is better. The only lacking goes in battery as it is only 3050 mah which is only for a day at brightness level 30. Had it been upto 4000 mah it would have been the complete handset without any argument/discussion. Value for money yes it is worth of.
Nokia 7.1,5,"Best for mid range if you are not mi, realme , oppo vivo lover","Pro.
Bright display
Nice processor
Android 9.0 Pie
4GB RAM is sufficient for above average
So many things to tell
Cons
Average battery life
Camera could be better
Overall 4.5/5"
Nokia 7.1,3,Nokia should upgrade RAM in this phone.,"Low light camera not so good.
Overall the phone is good"
Nokia 7.1,5,Shutter button,"While taking a selfie when we tilt the phone slightly, that is not getting clicked faster as the shutter button has to be tapped with lil  force for2-3 seconds which seems to be lil irritating while clicking selfies.  Or else everything is absolutely beautiful nothing is going wrong . Affordable and convenient üëå"
Nokia 7.1,5,Values for money,Nokia means trust I‚Äôm using Nokia 7.1 Therese is no issues good condition camera was sooooooo good if you have any doubts Ping ajaykumar.gundala.16@gmail.com but buy this Nokia phone
Nokia 7.1,1,Not recommended,Not worth the price..heats up very quickly.. everything else is okay. Battery drains quickly. The only problem I am facing is the heating problem
Nokia 7.1,5,THE ABSOLUTE BEST ALL-ROUNDER AT IT'S PRICE!!!!!,"****Writing this review after 3 months of usage!!!****
HMD Global has delivered a masterpiece with this one. The Nokia 7.1 is an absolutely fantastic device to use.
Build Quality and Design:: You will not get anything better than this in this price range. The device is absolutely gorgeous with it's all glass design and the aluminium unibody makes the phone look and feel premium. Also, the silver accents on my blue colour variant is especially eye-catching. The notch also isn't that obtrusive and you will get used to it quickly. All in all the build quality is comparable to the premium flagships.
Camera:: This device is a total beast when it comes to camera quality. The custom made Zeiss lens with Nokia signature software processing makes for some stunning shots. Just open the camera app, point on the scene and tap the shutter and let the software do it's magic. Also, the OZO tech makes for some lifelike sound quality in videos.
Performance:: This is one place where HMD could have done better. The SD636 chipset is a great performer for everyday usage and casual gaming but it struggles in graphic intensive tasks. But, at the price the processor choice could have been better but I'm not complaining because I don't use it for gaming that much.
And don't forget the Display:: The 5.84 inch HDR-10 compliant display delivers an elegant viewing experience as the screen is just beautiful to look at. The videos look sharp and the colour balance is best in the price range.
Verdict:: Go for this device eyes closed as this device wasn't meant for gaming because HMD designed it to be the perfect everyday smartphone and this one delivers it."
Nokia 7.1,4,Nokia brand,Good mobile from Nokia
Nokia 7.1,3,Avoid-Inadequate battery,"I am posting this review using a Nokia 7.1 which I have recently bought from Nokia's website.
The main issue is the battery which depletes fast. I watch YouTube at 240p and the phone becomes hot after a short while and the remaining battery percentage drops rapidly.
The HDR display feature, for me is pure gimmick because I personally prefer the display with this feature switched off. The quality of the display is very good otherwise, although the white balance is on the cooler side (bluish).
The stock camera has a noise reduction algorithm which makes low light photos acceptable, but this noise reduction algorithm is not available when other camera apps are used.
My previous phone was a Moto g3 and the quality of sound both through loudspeaker and headphones was better in that phone. The loudness of the loudspeaker is a little higher in Nokia 7.1 however.
The size of the notch is acceptable.
The call quality is very good although in loudspeaker mode the volume is low.
I am losing faith on Snapdragon 6xx because while scrolling webpages in Chrome there is stuttering which is annoying.
I expect all Nokia phones to have water repellant nano coating like Moto phones, otherwise customers can potentially face harassment in service centres for ""moisture damage"".
Finally, what is the point of glass back if the glass has to be secured using a plastic case. Don't fall for this gimmick.
It makes sense to utilise the space used by the glass on the backside to have a larger battery instead."
Nokia 7.1,4,battery problem,little bit battery life low....and processor ram and storage should be low light is good picture quality is 8 out of 10
Nokia 7.1,1,THIRD CLASS MOBILE,"Display is very bad, front censer is very very weak, During Call automatically MUTE HOLD or Speaker Button become swich On. i will Recommend never bay Nokia Product even in Half Price, within a week i throw My Nokia 7.1"
Nokia 7.1,1,Please do not even think to buy,Worst phone
Nokia 7.1,1,Heating Issue and Software Issue,Need to return this item because it has a heating Issue and there are software issues also. Filed for a return on 26th April which was two days before the allowed return time but nobody arrived to pickup the item. NEED TO REPLACE OR RETURN THIS ITEM IMMEDIATELY.
Nokia 7.1,3,Not Up to the Mark,"This product is not Up to the Mark, the quality of the Product you get is low to the cost that its Priced at..
instead of this better go with Samsung/ ASUS Brand Phones which are more Worthy buying..
Performs Just Average on camera and RAM management"
Nokia 7.1,5,Believe me or not but buy only Nokia.,"Complaint less Nokia 7.1..,. Only the battery should be 4000 MAH... No heating problem.or any other problem. Except battery."
Nokia 7.1,4,Very Good phone with some issues nokia should address,"I am reviewing after 25 days of use. The Nokia 7.1 I purchased after using 2 consecutive Motorola phones. The phone is awesome. Very beautiful phone. Speed and diaplay is good. Camera is good.
But phone is heating so much while charging.and using some apps. The charger provided not charging fast. I raised complaint with nokia care they asked me to reset phone, the problems will go off.  I did the same, fast charging issue resolved some what. But it is not charging as fast as Motorola. Heating issue is still there.
Camera is good but no front camera zoom. Nokia has to update its camera software."
Nokia 7.1,4,Nokia is back with good features,Nice phone easy to use good camera
Nokia 7.1,1,Bad experience  not worth,The product  is good but I had a bad experience  since I brought  it . It got hanged with showing  download mode n I had to repair  it 2 time since the time I brought  it now it's not even a month  now the 2 time still at the Nokia care center.the ppl are not even replace  the piece just given me reasons .not even used for 15 days now .
Nokia 7.1,4,Great deal if it undergoes 14k with android one series,Great display and good built quality with nice picture quality.
Nokia 7.1,5,Superb Product,Superb Product n the Amazon Delivery is perfect and within stipulated time ...
Nokia 7.1,5,About phone,Phone is good
Nokia 7.1,4,Super,Very nice product
Nokia 7.1,4,Premium Class,"Actually it is not a value for money product. It's a premium class product. The design,camera everything is perfect. Only demerit is the heat during charging. If your looking for a budget smartphone, don't try this. If you want a premium product with good features 7. 1 is a good option."
Nokia 7.1,4,Battery,It's really good mobile but the battery only 3000mha.. Nokia gives 4000mha the phone goes as a high peak.. it's main major negative
Nokia 7.1,1,I want refund,this mobile has too much lagging issue and and mobile getting switch off the time I am watching video in Chrome browser  again and again. charger taking too much time to charge my phone
Nokia 7.1,3,"Battery, apps, heat, files","No app lock, app hide, files hide, Bluetooth quality low, battry oky oky, sometimes heat, headphone sound less , no network speed showing"
Nokia 7.1,1,useless producr,very bad product battery drains too quickly

Nokia 7.1,1,Shouldn't have bought it.,"Mobile hangs up a lot...gets heated up very often...battery dies out soon...once the phone hangs, it doesn't get normal until battery dies out..."
Nokia 7.1,2,My Issues with Nokia 7 .1,"The phone is over heating. The phone got hang with some apps installed, like Gaana app. Screen Auto rotation is not working"
Nokia 7.1,5,Nokia 7.1 value for money,Nokia has bounced back with renewed vigour. Nokia was defacto standard of mobile phones. Nokia 7.1 android is worth every penny for it's price point. The phone is responsive. Display is good. Call clarity is good. Takes good pictures. Better than most Chinese phones. Love India. Don't buy Chinese.
Nokia 7.1,5,"Worth buying. Nokia, keep it up","I liked this product. Upto my expectations.
Good camera, good battery, sufficient memory.
Till now never got hanged. No heating problem."
Nokia 7.1,5,Beautiful Design By Nokia and beautiful performance...,"There is no negative feedback from my side.. Everything is perfect.Phone design is pretty cool.. Camera,speed.etc...all are good thanks to Nokia.."
Nokia 7.1,1,Please don't buy .just waste of money.i am telling because to save your money,It hang every time please don't buy.waste of money  photos in low light cannot be clicked  is phone screen is too small .
Nokia 7.1,5,A good all-round product,"Although better processors can be obtained for similar price the phone works perfectly fine, and is very smooth in day to day use as well as running medium sized games. (Shadow fight 3, Pubg, Asphalt 9 ran well)
The camera is really good, but you might have to use the pro mode to get better results when taking shots at night. The face recognition is the default from Google and is not that great, the phone can be unlocked even with your eyes closed.(It may change with future updates). The fingerprint is really snappy and always accurate, even with wet fingers.
The highlight of the phone though is the HDR 10 display, which is wonderful though sadly, you don't always get the HDR 10 content. Nevertheless media consumption is a delight on this phone.
The battery is fairly good easily lasting a full working day with low to moderate usage, you might have to plug it in between if you are a heavy user. The fast charger in the box is good and easily takes the phone from 0-50 in around 30 minutes.
The build quality is really good. It won't be an exaggeration to say that it might be the best in the segment. The glass back may be a cause of concern for some but with a proper cover the phone can easily take small impacts. The phone survived a 1.6m drop without even a scratch (keep in mind this is with the cover).
Personally speaking Android One is a delight, I really like the lack of bloatware and the clean UI. The updates are good and come on time.
Overall the phone is built for day to day usage and  is a really good choice for those who wish for an all round product."
Nokia 7.1,1,God bless Nokia and their users .,"Useless PHONE as speaker mike has stopped working within 10 days and I am forced to waste time behind service center .
Concern is it‚Äôs life expectancy Since first repair in 10 days doesn‚Äôt reflect its life more than 6 month .
I have chance to Nokia after long time and they disappointed as Indian manufacturing cannot match Finland manufactured quality of earlier time ."
Nokia 7.1,5,Good phone. Android one makes it awesome.,Very good camera. Good battery life.
Nokia 7.1,1,Please read all points care fully before purchasing,"After use of 1 Month phone is hanging and once i call to some one then show developing code on screen.
- Finger touch is too slow working.
- some time ringing phone but screen is off (not show number or name)
- Once phone use 15-20 minutes phone is too hot like iron.
- some time Bluetooth is not working properly.
- once use wi-fi then show some developing codes over there."
Nokia 7.1,2,Iam not satisfied with this phone.,I bought nokia 7.1 mobile phone from the retailer... Just one weeek back i hought this phone... But now i try to exchange the phone... The phone outlook is perfect . But the main ptoblem its very very slow in internet connecting .. before i used damsung j7 prime and i didnt get any net connecting problem in my location... But now iam facing a lot of issue in the ineternet connecting section.... Some times the phone is not connecting the internet even the data connection is on.. some times its very very slow in 4g connectivity.. and also the phone i bought just one week ago. But its hanging some times.... Some times we need to restart the phone if we need to use properly.... So iam not totally satisfied with tuis phone...
Nokia 7.1,5,Great for daily use,Great camera and  build quality...no complaints after 3 month of use
Nokia 7.1,1,Beware of Nokia phones,"I have purchased this phone in the month of December
Within three months PCB is damaged and service centre is asking 16k to repair this.
Earlier also it had issue with Bluetooth, certain apps,...
I had thought of giving one chance to this iconic brand but paid price for that
Beware of Nokia phones"

Nokia 7.1,3,Value for money,Ok

Nokia 7.1,5,Premium quality and comfortable,Best phone with really premium quality. Looks beautiful and it's very comfortable to hold phone with one also. Nokia best
Nokia 7.1,3,Overheating issues,"The phone is averall a good buy.
Issues I faced are overheating of the phone and lower battery performance."
Nokia 7.1,5,Best phone,Best phone value for money
Nokia 7.1,2,Hanging phone,It's very slow and always hanging
Nokia 7.1,5,Nice phone,Best mid-range phone
Nokia 7.1,1,Expected better product from nokia,"I was using leeco 1s (three years old) before buying this phone, that phone has lesser ram, slower processor, less rom compared to this phone, still that phone can run games perfect, this phone always lags while playing games. Camera is nice (this is the reason for 3 stars). Got scratches on screen very easily (not sure it really contains gorilla glass 3).
Edit - for first 3 months this phone was working fine but after 3 months I started getting issue with charging, I gave my phone for repair 3 times still it has issues. Nokia service center are also very bad, they never give warranty. All repairs come under liquid damage or physical damage, so that they don't have to give warranty."
Nokia 7.1,2,"Very unreliable while updating, don‚Äôt buy!","Though it uses stock android under AndroidOne, its very unreliable and my phone got stuck in download mode while applying OTA security update this morning.
I find that there are many owners with similar problem.
Since it is under AndroidOne program I feel Android and Nokia should have ensured that the security update doesn‚Äôt lead to problems at update stage.
This happened within two moths of purchase from Croma, Mulund, Mumbai and I am really disappointed over Android and Nokia. My 5 years old iPhone 6 never gave any problems.
Now this Nokia 7.1 may be my last Android and I have resolved not to get any Android phone in future."
Nokia 7.1,1,Dont Buy this device,"Dear Nokia,
Congratulations on coming out of the difficult phase you were facing and making good phones.
Here is one of my experience with the new age Nokia phones. I got a Nokia 7.1 on 11th January 2019. I was in love with the phone especially with the looks and the feel it had and also because it was Nokia and I had strong memories with Nokia Phones and my first phone was Nokia N72. After all the way awaiting your comeback and I finally got one and I was in love with your camera quality, build and design of Nokia 7.1. I felt very proud to have that phone.
Recently i noticed that despite of fast charging, I was unable to charge my phone properly and these days your phone is just an external organ. Thats why I connected to the support for the solution via MyPhone app provided by Nokia and did the same which was instructed but nothing happened. Then on Saturday 30th of March 2019, I took my phone to the service centre in Noida for the charging problem.I was made to wait for hours before service centre executive took my case and without even checking the phone properly, I was told the phone might be damaged because of some liquid and they cant say whether my phone can be repaired on not. I told them the fact that i never touched it with moist hand and i got a reply from the service centre executive it might be damaged coz of body sweat( Are you guys serious?). I then quickly called the customer care support and I was assured that the phone will be repaired in a week. I told this to the customer care executive and they said they can only tell the status after opening the phone and it will take another half n hour. I came back to the service centre again after half n hour and was again made to wait for an hour.
The service centre executive called me and said that my phone has a liquid damage without any proof but only a sticker inside the phone and i need to pay 1000 rs for the repair and it will take few days as parts are not available. Then I told him that my phone is in warranty and then he said that still  i had to pay for the damage despite being in warranty and I again asked him about the terms and warranty policies, he straight away said that the colour of sticker has changed and thats why my warranty is void. When i questioned him about two different statements, he said he will give that in writing that this phone is damaged by liquid and handset tempering. When i argued i was told they can do whatever they want.
I immediately called the Nokia customer care again and this time decided to make a video of the same. One of the technician named Mr Saurabh came outside and was about to hit my staff and used foul language because he was making a video of the wrongdoings in the service centre which made me angry and frustrated.
I can understand that may be i was wrong, but of all the people i met over there(more than 10 also in the video) who came for servicing of their phone was told by the executive that their phone has a liquid damage and their warranty is void.
Also they gave me a job sheet without a proper explanation of my damaged phone, when i asked them again they gave me another jobsheet explaining the problems which was not the case. Also the technician damaged the camera of the phone which is not working fine.
Now I failed to understand if its the problem with the phones or with the poor customer service. Either of the case its not going to take Nokia anywhere rather it will again go to zero."
Nokia 7.1,1,Phone is good,Phone is good but the Nokia seal was opened and returned.
Nokia 7.1,3,Not as per recommend,Not good as much
Nokia 7.1,2,Touch is very poor.,Not as per expectations
Nokia 7.1,4,It's good,Not bad
Nokia 7.1,1,"I was cheated, never experienced such a waste of money ever. every day I regret buying this.","The phone is not upto the expectations (and the expectations were average durable phone which sudnt trouble me much with regular functions). The sound quality is not good, speakers are pathetic vis a vis the high cost. I don't know if it's Android 9, but I needed to restore factory of this phone 2-3 times in last one month as one or the other apps malfunctioned for ex: the message (SMS) app didn't recieve all the msgs. Also after recent update, the phone gets hanged frequently."
Nokia 7.1,1,wost phone,"hi guys,
I bought a Nokia 5.1 plus from Flipkart 3 months ago. Now I m facing loudspeaker problem so I went to Nokia care at Borivali west at Saturday (23/3/2019)  around 2 0'clock and my IMEI/serial no. 356928092474578 and my jobsheetnumber :- 190323/014 issue was handled by Prachi Jadhav and technical guy Chirag, after 2 hours they lied to me by saying that my loudspeaker hardware got damaged by water  below are few things that show it's not possible:
1. my phone does not have a single dent or scratch so how does water get inside my phone. let's consider, somehow water managed to get inside my phone,  then why just a particular part of my phone (loudspeaker hardware)  got damaged.
2. Prachi and Chirag told me to give 1650 rs. I then received an SMS from Nokia support saying 750 rs/- would be charged as repairing charges, then why should I pay 1650rs as I mention in point 1 as well as my phone is in warranty.
3. Note: I have proof that they lied to me
guys remember one thing if you got faulty phone and you went to nokia care  they will say that it will damage by liquid (there is no meaning of warrent if you buy this phone that means you wasting money don't believe try it by your self) i my opinion buy Samsung or Redmi India or OPPO Branding Mumbai (it more than  2 year i haven't face any kind of issue)"
Nokia 7.1,4,"Stock android , very low camera quality","It is a mid range mobile . One good thing is stock android and it's security updates .
You have to manage camera in this phone , as it is not upto the mark wrt price ."
Nokia 7.1,5,Splendid!,"Good packaging, good delivery.
Phone: A true performer in its own right. Among the best midranges that money can buy. There are some slightly bit better value for money phones, but this phone is in a league of its own. With that money you not only buy a good overall performer that never lags, but the premium built worthy of a flagship pricetag and premium eye-catching design especially this glittering and shining Steel colour version.
No problems ever on everyday usage on various functions. Great update as expected of Android One.
Good camera, slightly weak on low light compared to premium Rs. 60000+ phones but who expects that? Still better than the likes of my friends' Redmi Note series, especially on Pro Mode and depth sensing (Portrait, background defocus). I have played around with Pro modes through the years and this phone is no dragger - it can chunk out impressive low light shots with the right Pro mode settings.
It is so beautiful and elegant even from the outside - everytime you see it, there's a smile inside of you. It has been dropped 3 times till now, but no scratches, dents or damages inside and out."
Nokia 7.1,1,Worst phone,"Worst phone. Dont buy it. Within a year phone is dead and nokia care is unable to solve the problem even if it is in warranty
period."
Nokia 7.1,4,If u compromise with battery then u should buy this.,Only battery and network connectivity issue.
Nokia 7.1,5,From Gadgets 360.,"Brilliant smartphone under the price tag. You will get a premium feel while using it. It's design and build feels premium. Worth buying phone.
Cameras are brilliant. Low light photography is excellent. And a stock Android one gives all what a user want.
Gets slightly warm after excess usage but still a brilliant smartphone to buy at such price. Performance wise it features a Snapdragon choose 636 similar to the previous model of Nokia i.e. Nokia 6.1 plus. So, not much performance difference between the two. But still if you want better cameras and premium feel and a bloat free software you should pick this one."
Nokia 7.1,4,"Best display, Excellent camera, Average battery backup.",Totally satisfied with this mobile except battery. Superb camera quality. Excellent display. Superb built quality.  Value for money. Must buy.
Nokia 7.1,5,Good Come back Nokia with Rationalize behaviour...,I will always stand  with Nokia and team....Nokia 7.1 steel is amazing mobile..... features are very good.

Nokia 7.1,1,Honest review :: please never buy....It has lots and lots of problems..Please don't waste your money,"Phone is looking is very prime., but the most important part is performance., always hangs with some apps., especially in whatsapp., got frustrated., if you want just look and you can hold with 30% hangover 100% use of your mobile can go with this mobile., But I will repeat, it hangs., Camera is great in that is price range and battery life not bad and  not too great. the display is very very great.. sound is also okay,., it is not fast charging as expected., but charge bit faster than normally charging."

Nokia 7.1,5,Nice Nokia,After one month use i post this the phone is unique as the brand name Nokia
Nokia 7.1,3,Good,Photography experience is aweome but battery back up is very poor Need to work on.
Nokia 7.1,1,Disappointing one,Please don't purchase any nokia device. Worst devices. If you purchase this 7.1 you are going to waste your money at all. Worthless nokia.
Nokia 7.1,4,Little slow,It's little slow when use FB and other heavy apps run rest of all are good one

Nokia 7.1,1,"Hanging problem, touch problem, battery problem, connectivity problem, apps doesn't work","Worst phone you can can ever imagine & so as Amazon customer service, this phone is having hell lot of problems from the 1st day & I'm trying for the replacement but no help provided by the customer care, don't buy Nokia cell phones !"
Nokia 7.1,5,Nice,Excellent product
Nokia 7.1,1,Worst Mobile Ever I dont Write Review's usually but i will write this to save you'r money,"There are many issues with Mobile..
Slow Charging, Worst Battery Performance, APP crashes Frequently, Touch Display Issue, Speaker Issues.
Pros - Camera is good
PS--Not even worth of paying a penny to this mobile..
Save your money go for DIff Mobile.."
Nokia 7.1,5,Great is the word,Best phone I bought do far. Much better than MI and iPhone. Battery is good for a day and a half.
Nokia 7.1,5,"Unless you're a gamer, you're guaranteed to be impressed","Review after a month of usage. Sweet to look at and hold. Camera is very intuitive for people who really want to mess around manually. I recommend using Snapseed to really bring out the best out of the RAW files. It'd be a dream if it had Amoled but the IPS screen is best in its class and the colour reproduction is the most accurate of all the midrange devices. Audio drivers are pretty sick on normal earphones and I can't wait to try them with monitoring headphones. Battery management is really good on Android pie but it's size (3.1mAh) leaves a little to be desired in 2019. RAM management is aggressive but I've had no problems multitasking at all. It definitely helps to extend the battery so it doesn't matter if a few chrome tabs are sacrificed for a couple of hours of extra juice at the end of the day.
It won't win any gaming benchmarks so if you really want to play PUBG in this price range, getting the Pocofone is a no brainer."
Nokia 7.1,4,Look,"Good mobile, for use to gentleman."
Nokia 7.1,1,Don't buy Nokia products,"The worst product I used till now,half of the display was gone dim from within a week I havr purchased,they closed the return window within a week"

Nokia 7.1,5,Super Value for money.,Android one makes it more comfortable and easy to access all the apps and easy customisation...
Nokia 7.1,5,Ok but you can get much more at this cost,average
Nokia 7.1,5,Awsm,Awsm phn
Nokia 7.1,3,Not as good as it is advertised.,"The build is good and elegant.
You cant navigate to see the photo that you have just clicked.I thought that they might give updates for that but they didn't.Camera takes too much time to focus. And ambient brightness reponse time is so slow that often you end up with zero visibility in daylight"
Nokia 7.1,1,Not buy,Heat up and poor battery life and some settings not work properly.
Nokia 7.1,5,Thanks Nokia,"I am using this Nokia 7.1 for two months now, this one is really a good phone. Value for money surely. Picture quality, battery backup is good as expected. Definitely recommend this phone. If your budget is higher go for 8.1"

Nokia 7.1,4,No value for money,Price is little higher as per the configuration it should be priced near 15000 INR.
Nokia 7.1,1,"Don't buy this mobile, you will regret for sure","Worst phone, not worth of 20k,
1. fake fast charging , it take 30mins for first 50% and takes 1.30 hrs for remaining 50%, total 2+hrs for full charge
2.battery drains very quickly
3. Yellow spot appeared on screen after 3 weeks of usage
4. Very bad sound quality on loud speaker
5. music quality is pathetic
6. Screen size also small
7.youtube rendering is bad, full screen wont display properly
8.lot of heat while charging
9.worst customer service
10. And many more...."
Nokia 7.1,3,Good phone,Not very well
Nokia 7.1,5,Excellent Product,"This product is excellent, hence felt its valuable for the price. This had given excellent product i purchased till date."
Nokia 7.1,1,Device heat temperature upto 45 celsius,"Very slow , hangs frequently .
Bought is 8 days back and very disappointed
In one line don't waste money on it"
Nokia 7.1,3,"Performance lag even for basic operations, heats up like frying pan","Pro - Good build quality, High resolution (considering the range), Android One
Cons - Performance lag even during basic app usage (very often), mobile heats up after using it for 10-15  mins, battery life isn't great (i don't play games and i have to sometime charge twice a day)
Overall I am not satisfied with this phone. I could have lived with all other issues if not for the performance lag. I fail to understand how can there be so much lag with Snapdragon 636. Looking at other's review, I sometime wonder if it is only with my phone."
Nokia 7.1,5,Excellent choice...,Excellent display. Solid build quality... Not satisfied with low light selfie...
Nokia 7.1,1,Phone hanged and auto restart multiple times with in one month of operation. Very bad quality.,I bought it in Jan'19 and since beginning hanging and auto restart problem occurred into it. I am regularly visiting Nokia service center since last 9 months but they didn't find solution for my Nokia 7.1 phone. They swapped it 02 times but same auto restart problem also persist into both swap handset. I shown Nokia HMD person and Nokia service center video evidences of said problem but now they are denying to give any replacement or solution to my Nokia 7.1 problem. Pls don't buy Nokia phones and never trust their services.

What should i do.. please Help"
Nokia 7.1,4,"pretty much satisfied, but could have been better","The phone is pretty good, but in the starting i experienced some issues such as phone switching off automatically and heating issues when the phone is being charged, these issues poped up on the very first day that i got my hands on the product, now those issues subdued and the phone is running smooth. Other thing, i have played pubg mobile, as far as my experience goes the phone could not handle the game, i mean the game was laggy, apart from that i am pretty satisfied with the phone. Not to brag but i expected a lot more from an established brand, having said that the phone is pretty good for the daily normal use."
Nokia 7.1,5,Good phone,You will like it
Nokia 7.1,1,Worst product from Nokia,"Mobile hangs frequently.
Not Able to multiple apps at the same time.

Nokia 7.1,2,Restarting,"Having restarting issues.
Otherwise it's ok."
Nokia 7.1,5,Good one.,A bit pricey but overall worth it.
Nokia 7.1,5,Class vs Mass,Bought it from a nokia retailer... It is like Choosing between Class and Mass.... Its not of everybody taste..  Becoz you get similar feature with other phones costing at 10 or 11 thousand... But again... Nokia is known for its Build quality and Finish... Its more beautiful lookin then any other smartphone even on par with Apple Iphones... Plus the Size is superb the build quality... the look.. when u take out frm ur pocket it surely get your attention.... So its like a Business class phone like Blackberrys...  Either u love it or hate it... I personally prefer classy and Business class things which are highly sophisticated.  so This phone is Like having Entry Level Mercedes Benz... you got the name... u got the quality... But u surely not get what u get in the most expensive model of Skoda or Toyota...
Nokia 7.1,1,Want to return waste of money,"Phone Hangs too much, return window is closed , Want to return this pathetic phone , it's just a waste of money nothing else. Amazon please help if you can in returning this nokia7.1"
Nokia 7.1,3,Not upto the Nokia mark,Within this price we can get so many better mobiles
Nokia 7.1,1,Please dont buy,"In initial use it was nice to use. In a weeks time I felt performance issue, speed & battery issue.
It worth not more than 10k."
Nokia 7.1,3,Not bad,Nice
Nokia 7.1,3,Do look premium but Performance is not so good,Handset looks premium....but low processor for price such as 18000 rs phone only has great camera quality than it's lower model Nokia 6.1.Doesn't have good performance in 18000 rs
Nokia 7.1,1,Not a good option. No Nokia Again,"Call drops frequently
Restarts automatically
I would suggest not to buy this. It's been just a week I bought and I already have issues"
Nokia 7.1,5,Worthy,Good picture quality
Nokia 7.1,4,Good,Good
Nokia 7.1,2,Item need to exchange as there's a software problem,"Model appearance is good which I liked. But there is software issue. Video is getting hanged. Display is getting hanged. Touch is not working at some places on screen.
Need to get an exchange"
Nokia 7.1,5,Premium Product that's worth buying!!,"I have been using this phone for 7 days. I have been using this for my daily chores like setting up remainders, writing mails, creating to do list, photography and music. Except gaming, I use this phone for each and every purpose and I am fully satisfied with it.
HDR 10 display is amazing which provides clear images even when brightness is full.
And the camera with f 1.75 with 12+5 MP camera provides crisp clear images even in low light conditions.
During calls, I found the loudspeaker to be bit low but an update can fix the bug.
Otherwise sound quality is crisp, sharp and clear although not loud but awesome for hearing in a room. With headphones of Sony,it feels heaven.
Ram management is also too good. And the battery management & backup is too satisfying for me as it provides me a whole day charge."
Nokia 7.1,1,Horrible experience,I never see such utter waste phone in my life. I have purchased 1st in Dec.2018. Display issue arised. I have returned and received a new phone. 2nd phone issue with charging. That also I have returned and waiting for money back.
Nokia 7.1,5,I m In love üòç,Excellent mobile
Nokia 7.1,4,Value for money,Value for money
Nokia 7.1,1,Bad Experience,"Nokia need big improvement.... Like heat issues, and üîã"
Nokia 7.1,5,Awesome,"Best phone from Nokia under mid range..
Specially the build quality"
Nokia 7.1,3,Average,Average product
Nokia 7.1,5,Premium Purchase!!,"The name Nokia is a symbol of trust. That being said, you are simply paying for the brand and to be quite honest, the specifications offered do not justify the price point. But again, it is Nokia. Starting with the display, it is very crisp and feels premium. The notch is neither too small nor too large. You will get used to it within a couple of days even if you have not used any notch display device before. The rear camera is good and full of features but the front camera requires some software updates from Nokia. The total overall outer look and design of this phone is truly out of the world and undoubtedly gives a premium feel. The sleekness and compact design makes this phone easy to operate with a single hand.
Speaking about the touch response, you won't get any issues with that, but the fingerprint sensor does lag sometimes. I have a OnePlus 6 as well that offers inbuilt App locker which is not available in this phone. That means, you have to download third party app lockers that contain irritating ads and can cause your phone to hang.
My overall take on this phone is satisfactory. Even with a couple of cons, I give no less than 5 star rating to this device. Simply because, it is a Nokia and Nokia never disappoints when it comes to durability."
Nokia 7.1,1,Very bad phone,"I have purchased two Nokia 7.1, one gets heat once in a day. Another one stopped working first day itself . Reply from the amazon customer service is very bad. I never suggest anybody to buy phones from Amazon."
Nokia 7.1,4,Built quality is great,Very nice mobile and nice built quality
Nokia 7.1,4,Good mobile,"Its a good mobile, based on the two day usage of the mobile. Picture quality is good."
Nokia 7.1,5,"A wonderful phone, an overall package","Had bought this phone two days ago.
It's slim and wonderful to hold, though a bit slippery, definitely recommend buying a cover asap
The screen is one beauty, Colors are great to look at, provides an immersive experience
Comes with Oreo out-of-the-box, update to Pie is immediately available.
Performance is superb, haven't faced any lags, even while playing Asphalt 9
There is slight heating while charging and prolonged gaming, but that should fade away once the system gets used to the usage demands of the user
Camera is a real beauty, specially the Live Bokeh mode
Battery backup is average, if you are a hard-core user, you might need to look for the charger by evening, regular users can manage to get on for a day
Overall, this phone is a great buy, it's slightly overpriced (2-3k), but it's worth it. Nokia has indeed done a fantastic job with this phone, would definitely recommend this to all"
Nokia 7.1,4,Awesome phone,"Smooth Touch, Camera is good. Have google lens.  Overall phone is awesome and worth money.
Drawback :
1. No notification light
2. No call recording feature
3. No inbuilt applock feature..
4. Text messages cannot be deleted multiple i can be deleted one by one
5. Switch off again and again
6. No fast charging"
Nokia 7.1,2,Mobile Heating & poor glass quality,Screen Glass and Back Glass have cheap quality. This mobile is heating while doing charging even if mobile is switched off and also heating at back side while using camera.
Nokia 7.1,4,All rounder,It is made for people who use less for gaming. I shifted from Moto Z2 play. Camera is great not the best but better than 6.1 plus. and it's little bigger than an iPhone.The display is good Colors are soft on eyes
Nokia 7.1,1,Not worth the buck!,"It's too expensive and the after sales support in India is hopeless. Battery isn't that good, prone to cracking, it's very slippery. Greesy hands spoil the look.
However the worst of all is after sales support.
I suggest go for some other android one phone"
Nokia 7.1,5,nokia is best,Super quality best mobile
Nokia 7.1,4,Nice look..,Good looking with light weight and ofcourse user friendly.
Nokia 7.1,4,Handy mobile from nokia in a big display trending time these days,"Display-color and contrast is fantastic u can compare it with amoled display panels
Design and build quality- here nokia have done great job it's feel like premium in hand and very comfortable for small hand also
Sound- sound from bottom firing speaker is very loud and clear it's a bit loouder then redmi note 5 pro
Camera-camera quality is quite satisfing in this segment pictures of rear camera you can see in samples front camera is good in daylight but it's struggle in low light
Battery-battery is enough for one day normal usage in heavy usage u could charge it twice in a day
Performance-this phone comes with snapdragon 636 proccesser which is enough for day to day task its antutu benchmark score is 115000 which is quit good
Overall a good phone from nokia with a bit higher price"
Nokia 7.1,5,NOKIA can beat IPHONES.,"Very good product from NOKIA. Company focused on more on design, but can pay attention to features as well. But Android 9.0 PIE version can overcome this.
Camera, speaker and touch sensitivity is very good, screen looks like equivalent to AMOLED, hence no need to go for chinese phones even though it provide AMOLED option, as it is far better than other phones.
NOKIA was and can again become a market leader, if it more focused on features along with design.
very premium design as compare to costliest phone on earth. provide almost all features compare to other phones from top range to mid range smartphones hence one can go for it if you want to use it for business or gaming/entertainment purpose, this phone should be in your priority buying list.
Network, user interface, Android ONE everything works well too.
I received a product where I cannot play the music 3.5 mm jack fully inserted into the space it provide as it is not working for me, and I have to little bit pull it when I need to listen a music or need to join a call, so this is a bit dissatisfied me when I use it personally, otherwise its good to buy,
Again NOKIA needs to focus more on phone feature and quality in terms of technical usability other design is best in class."
Nokia 7.1,5,"Handy, strong and no non-sense phone","Phone's size is perfect for single palm usage. Performance is good and camera is good for its price.
It's not made for hardcore gaming so don't expect that at all. However, the neat and clean Android One, size and build makes it for a great daily driver for work, business, music and media consumption."
Nokia 7.1,5,Hot and awesome,"Nokia is back.  Im using it from last 10  days it's awesome. I came from OnePlus 5 to Nokia 7.1 ..and I regret my decision.. display is awesome..
Camera is good
Software is fluid
Great built
Awesome design..
Nothing to complain abt.  Ppl thinking it's highly priced but they have no idea Nokia in 7.1 HDR enabled display and Carl Zeiss camera .."
Nokia 7.1,4,Good phone for but little overpriced,"Most good looking phone at this price range. Steel body is so sexy. Only concern is battery it should have been 3500mah or more nowdays. Camera is good, better with gcam port. Display is great when hdr is on. Definitely little overpriced. But i got it on hdfc emi offer. Stock android is nice experience vut i miss some widgets and dual apps features. Add OIS camera and 4000mh battery then no fight at 20k"
Nokia 7.1,1,Defective Product,"Received defective product from Amazon, Post first set up it hanged twice within 2 days and now after 6 days of usage it completely not starting up. In 2015 I had Lumia 730 and that mobile still working without any issue. Not sure what Nokia is doing here. I wasted  20k for nothing."
Nokia 7.1,1,Don't buy from cloudnine India dealer,"The phone looks good,it's stylish.Size of information in the display is small.The mobile gets heated a lot.Sometimes the mobile get hanged.I bought the product from cloudnine India dealrr,they gave me a unsealed product,that too a dameged product.I got a Sim card error.so,because of that dealer I give one starting this mobile."
Nokia 7.1,2,.....,Build quality is awesome but I‚Äôm fadeup with operating system and poor hardware
Nokia 7.1,4,Premium looking smart phone,"Built quality is very premium, better than cheap looking Chinese brands. Screen quality is very high quality. It has Android PIE with stock OS that has no extra apps and works like a charm. I didn‚Äôt face any software or hardware problem as mentioned in other reviews. Looks very nice in hand. Only cons I can think of is Nokia could have provided better specs (e.g 6gb ram or 128GB storage) in this price segment and a bulging out camera housing. It‚Äôs a premium looking smart phone which is well built."
Nokia 7.1,1,Sad experience,Phone got switched off the next day of purchase I had to reboot it. Camera hangs always .Every time have to restart the phone to make one or the other apps to work.i have to wait one week to get appointment with the technician. First they told to factory reset it and even after doing that still it persists will replace.when I called Amazon after factory reset and still facing problem they told technician will come and check and then with his approval only I will get replacement.and I have to wait one week to get appointment.
Nokia 7.1,1,Nokia  7.1plud bl,In even its not sim opening sim tray
Nokia 7.1,1,Waste of money,"I'm using Nokia 7.1 ,, worst mobile ,, waste of money , no Call recording , no face lock , light sensor not available , type c charger but no fast charger. 100% charger time 2.30 hrs"
Nokia 7.1,1,Waste of money and time.,"Nokia not advertised , Airtel  volte not available .
Real-time GPS Not working ."
Nokia 7.1,4,"Thank you, Nokia","Always been Nokia user. Coming back to family after 2-3 yrs. Nokia and pure Android works well together. Though just the 1st week.
Display is amazing.
Camera is good.
Pure Android is always awesome.
Nokia's feel when handheld.
Battery should have been better.
Looking forward."
Nokia 7.1,4,It's an underdog of the mobile phones from Nokia,"I bought this product directly from outside retailer and after a month of usage I can tell you that this phone is one of the best I have used.
I was using one plus 3 before this and coming down to Nokia 7.1 was a difficult choice but I also don't want to spend huge sum of money on a mobile device this time and after searching for a lot of time went ahead with this device.
Pros:
1. Android One : I got Android pie update right out of the box and also the security patch for December. Android one devices will be provided with all the updates from Google for 3 years and this is amazing for the price you pay here. The Nokia 7.1 will still be running smooth and upto date when while other phones you might have to change.
2. Battery life : I was sceptical about this as there were very few reviews available for this device in the market. But trust me guys, this cell is amazing in battery backup. It has the best use of RAM management and stock Android gives the battery usage a boost. I am a medium to heavy user so it would give you a days battery life without any difficulty. Though actual usage depends on your use.
3. Picture Quality : This is the top most reason why people buy the cell phone and who doesn't love a great picture, right ? If you do then this will satisfy your needs of a photographer inside you. Zeiss lens does an amazing job at capturing crisp and real images. I have a Redmi Note 6 Pro as well whose camera captures the images with a more yellow skin tone than your actual skin tone while the Nokia 7.1 captures it in all real tone, which might not seem a big deal but trust me when you see it is.
4. RAM : Random Access Memory is something which performs well when the RAM management of the device is proper. 4GB RAM of Nokia 7.1 does a far greater job at making it an amazing task master. It can handle loads of tasks simultaneously and without giving you any heating issue.
5. Build Quality & Design : It's the top of the class. When you hold it in your hand, you will go just staring at this masterpiece of a craftsmanship. The curves and metal body is beautiful and gives you a connoisseur type of appeal. It can't be matched by any phones out there.
Cons: The things I think could have been better.
1. Selfie camera : In day light it's amazing. But in low light it doesn't perform the best. Has a too much of sharpness and might spoil the image. Also it's just 8 megapixel but does a fabulous job in day time and in nightime as well where there are proper house lights.
2. Battery Charging : coming from One plus 3 the USB type-c charger is also available in this device but the charger given is not that fast. I would recommend using a Nokia approved USB type-c charger as this device approves fast charging. Also the battery should be around 3500 mah or more going by the competition but I think this battery backup also does the job quite well.
Result:
It's important to see how a smartphone functions the best in all that is given to it. We think that more is better but I think these people have made a choice of providing the adequate resources which are tweaked for making the performance better. Mind you not, Nokia as we know is a brand who is still the best out there, giving quality and sturdy devices like it used to give us way back and by using this device my faith in them has increased.
Some of you will feel that the price you are paying is more for what you get. I agree but there is always a premium attached to a brand's name. With the extra you pay, you get the less if you compare with other smartphones but the QUALITY you get is just unmatched.
It's a smooth lag free experience with Nokia 7.1.
My recommendation 4.3 stars overall and would suggest you to go and buy this product if the above description of the review matches you."
Nokia 7.1,5,Thanks to Nokia,Nice only
Nokia 7.1,5,Nokia with premium look & satisfying features!,"If you're looking for a phone with a premium look and handy features in it just like me! Don't waste your time just go for it. I assure you it is most premium phone in this range. It's HDR10 supportive screen is just awesome. Just fits proper in your hands. I often find many phones hard to handle..like some cheap plastic pieces but not in this. Nokia gives you a beauty!
Features I like the most-
Pure HD HDR10 supportive screen
Premium look
Glossy steel finish body
Handy.
Fast Charging"
Nokia 7.1,3,Facing issues,Phone is overall good but I am facing issues with SMS app. Unable to send and receive messages from the set. If problem doesn't get resolved then may return the phone. Message issue not yet resolved.  Nobsupport from Nokia.  But i am still using the phone and overall performance is good apart from few issues.
Nokia 7.1,1,Dis appointed with the product,"Purchased Nokia 7.1 recently after the 4 days of the purchasement camera gets struck frequently and apps doesn't function hangs ofently, even the back option doesn't work.
Nokia 7.1 is not the worth of 20k."
Nokia 7.1,5,Mini Powerhouse,"Great Phone from Nokia. I generally use only Flagship phones. I already have a Samsung Galaxy Note 9 but needed a secondary phone. So, I Bought this. This being a Nokia & also Android One Device was a good choice. Below are the Pros & Cons I've observed.
Pro's:
1. Superb Display (FHD & HDR Support)
2. Excellent Build Quality
3. Nice Camera's (Zeiss)
4. Excellent Haptic Feedback Motor (Even my Note 9 doesn't give this level of feel).. Just feels like Pixel 3.
5. Pure Stock Android (Already been updated to Pie).
6. The display is 5.8 inch so after using above 6 inch phones for a long times this feels just Awesome.
7. Battery normally lasts one full day & by the night it has around 20% of the charge left. I don't play games that much though.
Cons: Not Many
1. The Chin... Believe me its Big (U can ignore the top notch but not the Chin its that Bad.
2. Pricing should have been around 15K.
3. Though it packs a 18W fast charger & charges the phone fast til 80% but the last 20% almost takes 45 minutes. I don't play games that much.
Verdict: Purchase this phone during sales when the price comes around 15K. Its a really smooth & pleasurable experience. ***Manufacturers should make a small flagship device I feel, bcoz this really feels so comfortable."

Xiaomi Mi A3,4,"I got this phone for the stock android experience, stayed for the good hardware","Having long followed the Xiaomi MiA series, from the MiA1 & MiA2, the hardware and features have always been very good, with assured OS updates up to 2 years. With this I decided to get the MiA3, and it has been a good experience.
The good: Being stock android, without a skin and without bloatware, everything feels clean and fast. 6GB RAM and the SD 665 processor are sufficient for day to day tasks.
The main 48 MP camera (Sony sensor, used in so many different phones including the Redmi K20 and K20 Pro, Oneplus 7 series, etc.) is really good with details and in most conditions the exposure and white balance is good. This can be further bettered with different camera apps, even the Gcam port for the phone (as the phone supports camera 2 API). The wide angle camera isn't as sharp as the primary camera, but it is quite decent for what it is, specially in day light conditions (indoor and low light photos turn out quite soft).
The battery life is pretty good, heavy usage lasting for the whole day (mainly media consumptions and playing games). Call quality and dual network reception is great as well.
The mediocre/bad:
The only complaint I have with the phone is the slow fingerprint reader, and I knew about it before I purchased the phone - I can live with it because the rest of the package is good value for the price. The display, while being OLED, is bright enough and generally enjoyable, but the resolution and perceived sharpness is a little less than some other phones. It is not bad, just OK.
Overall if you are looking for stock android with no bloatware and assured OS updates, this is a good buy."
Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Must buy,One of the best mobile phone in this price range. Everything is just more than perfect except battery life. On display fingerprint scanner is really good to watch but not as per mark. Stock android with Xiaomi is good enough for use.
Xiaomi Mi A3,1,A3 - Not Useful Phone,This phone within 6 months of usage appears to be a huge waste

Xiaomi Mi A3,4,Best Midrange Phone,"The Phone is overall good, but its battery doesn't seems like 4000 mah, it's drain out within 8 hrs. Camera is way more better as compared to other mid range phones. Comfortable grip, Light weight."
Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Okk,It's ok
Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Improve fingerprint scanner,"Fingerprint reader very slow, otherwise good product"
Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Can't use SD card with both SIMs,Worst thing about this phone is one can not use external SD card with both SIMs in use. If SD card is used you have to take out the one SIM. How much it takes to design a phone that can adjust a small SD card?

The battery lasts for more than 24 hours if you are not gaming heavily. My mom managed more than 2 days. Forgot to mention that I have got MI A2.
On screen fingerprint readers are always slow for any device.
Lastly I want to mention that it's an Android one device with regular security updates and fast, simple and secure. And expect new features when major updates will be released."

Xiaomi Mi A3,2,"Fingerprint reader is very slow, and may not recognize half of the time.",Phone look is nice. good battery and charges as it was said. It's processor is good n quick to open apps to use. How ever to unlock we might face issues with finger print reader. it may or may not recognize your finger at all.  Not satisfied with camera also. This product is not having wifi calling.  Not yet received android 10 as per their promotion.

Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Osm,I like this phone because it's quality is osm
Xiaomi Mi A3,4,Gorgeous device with a few rough edges,"Insanely good looking and premium looking device for the price. The material used to build the phone is excellent. I was specially surprised to see the metal frame used is as good as in highly priced premium devices. Camera is also decent for its price, though processing I wish, was faster. An HD screen sounds poor in today‚Äôs day and age but the screen on this device is way better than a standard 720p screen. The colours I wish could be toned-down. Not sure why a vanilla Android 9 does not give that as an option. One gripe that I have is the speed of the finger print sensor. My god, it‚Äôs so slow! Many times I almost gave up on it and thought it‚Äôs not working. Lastly, I don‚Äôt understand why a vanilla Android Version of 10 is still not available on the device while Android 10 has been released publicly for over 3 months now. Overall though, it‚Äôs a good purchase. I recommend it as a good budget option for people having budget of 12-15K. There are other device, but it‚Äôs a relief to know that your software will be updated for at least 2-3 years in a device which is in this price bracket. I say, go for it."
Xiaomi Mi A3,4,The compact phone.,"Even though so many great phones available in this price and feature range I bought this phone because its really impressed me by its amazing design. Its compact at the same time its screen size is 6"". The performance is not so good and not bad and can say good. Moreover its pure android. Both cameras also super. And one more thing about its display, we will not bother about it even it is HD+ but Amoled compensate it. I will suggest this for those who love stock android and a compact design."

Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Worthy Mobile,A money worth product. Interface and the physical appearance is damn super.
Xiaomi Mi A3,4,Excellent balanced feature set,"After using the device for 3 days, I am satisfied with the performance overall.
Pros:
Very good grip feel in the hand. Don't feel it will slip out.
The gradient paint at the back is very attractive and gives a unique premium look.
Good camera quality. Pictures appear sharp even after zooming a lot.
Decent battery life. With my moderate usage and constant traveling, my earlier redmi4 used to drain by 8pm from a full charge in the morning. But this lasts the night.
Decent multi tasking and fast response in apps and browser.
Good speaker quality but not very good.
Does not heat even after playing videos for long times.
Cons:
The screen is tough to see in the sun even with full brightness.
The fingerprint reader is slow to unlock although it looks cool for a phone at this price.
Though the phone supports fast charging, it is not fast enough.
It feels delicate and breakage prone if not handled gently.
But overall, a great balanced phone with decent performance for an average user."
Xiaomi Mi A3,2,Battery problem,"Took it on Aug 2019,
Sensor which makes screen light off when calling is not working 100%.

Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Cool,Cool
Xiaomi Mi A3,5,A capable phone with stock Android,"Honestly I was quite sceptical about the purchase before it arrived since I was already using a Note 5Pro with highest specs. With very less number of stock Android phone available, I thought to give it a try.
After using it for a week I can confidently say that my assumption was not wrong. It has a solid hardware and the best is its camera quality coupled with a nice image processing. Although I use GCAM, but still I feel there is very little difference between the stock camera. The form factor of the phone is exactly what I was looking for, since I don't prefer huge phones. The battery backup, performance is excellent for the given price. There are many complaints about the 720P display but believe me, its hardly noticeable if you're not a pro gamer or HD freak.
Only thing I am not liking is the fingerprint scanner. It's slow and not accurate, but I guess it has something to do with the blue anti glare tempered glass which I'm using.
In one word, I'm satisfied."

Best android camera phone under 20K.
Battery is 4000Mah, which is okay for 1day use, where phones are available in same range with 5000-6000 Mah.
If you are using only limited apps & WiFi, battery will lasts upto 1.5-2 days.
On Screen fingerprint reader- works fine, but not getting comfort like the legacy one, may due to new experience
Apart from fingerprint, it has face screen unlock option also.
AMOLED Display is awesome.
Sound output is descent.
No heating problem with normal use.
Android one software platform is the main plus of this phone, so u will get direct security updates from Google.

Xiaomi Mi A3,4,Compact Google Phone,"I'm using 3 past months :
Pros :
Stock Android
Clean and neat no bloat ware
Speedy processor SD665 was nice
Excellent Camera front and back triple camera,
Good battery backup
Struggle free performance
Best design and compact phone light weight
Speaker loudness was good and very good output.
Gurantee Software updates.
Cons :
Under display finger print slow sometimes not working
Face unlock not so much fast sometimes struggle,
Some of the phone comes with bundle 18wat charger but this one 10wat charger with the box
AMOLED display but HD resolution (but display is good and support Netflix and prime)
Verdict :
Your ok with compact amold hd resolution mobile with no worries about face unlock and finger sensor speed then consider
Above Cons will be fix on upcoming softwares update on upcoming Android 10 release on Feb 2nd week then go ahead I'm strongly recommend."
Xiaomi Mi A3,2,Think before you opt for it,"I used it for 4 months now, here are my findings.

Also MI also not responding when this update comes. Don't know mi is not interested or what?
Other thing mi always gives update by end of month like in December I got update  by Dec 18,2019. In other hand I was using Nokia 6.1. plus in that I always gets update by 5th every month
Rest phone is good. Finger print lacks but okay. Camara is not as massive as mi says. I don't feel wow difference between Nokia 6.1. plus and a3"
Xiaomi Mi A3,1,"No call recorder ,,we can't hide the data that is in massage notification ,,no app lock","Wastage of money ,,,there is no call recorder,,and compass app ,we can't search the recent number if it doesn't save in the phone ,,,,we can't search numbers by typing the last numbers of anyone contact,,,in notification of massages we can't hide only text of massage,,,,very very bad experience"

Xiaomi Mi A3,1,Hyped mobile,"I liked the looks of the product other than that I am disappointed with everything else. Pictures of people look like they have applied paint on the face. Battery life is good like any other phone when you purchase it new. Nothing special about this phone from a layman's point of view.
Double tap enlarges the screen but bringing it back to normal is difficult.
When you are on call the screen enlarges on it's own n various features like mute or loud speaker gets activated.
I am totally unhappy with the phone n it's performance."
Xiaomi Mi A3,5,TO GOOD,This product is too good and delivery to amazon it is more good.
Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Best phone for money's  worth,"Wonderful phone, sometimes the proximity sensor malfunctions in the model like if u keep the phone near the ears the screen will be sometime be on .
1.Battery life is good it gives a continous video play of around 10- 12hrs
2.Camera quality is awesome
3.OS in this phone (android one) is far superior to other android phone which means it does not have unwanted system apps and there no advertisement in the phone compared to miui os ,and the ram management is wonderful
4.the display is viberant since it is amoled but if u see in ur naked eye closely the pixels can be seen
5.the display fingerprint is a bit late to respond compared other rear fingerprint scanner"

I suggest you to recall the phone from the market as it has not been a good experiment on the competition side. ""Save The Brand""."
Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Just average,Fingerprint isn't quick but the phone is quite nice
Xiaomi Mi A3,2,Phone sensor not working,"I bought MI A3 in August 2019 and the sensor is not working. While a call is in progress, the screen become black and i am unable to do anything with the phone during the pendency of the call. I would like the phone replaced because it is within warranty.

OneStopShop Conclusion
‚Ä¢ The video experience is better than Redmi note 8 pro but needs to work in the software part for much refine video experience.
‚Ä¢ Sharpness is increased too much which results in strain on eyes and end output also gets affected.
‚Ä¢ 128GB of storage gets the work done as cloud storage takes care of the rest of the content.
‚Ä¢ Security Patches are thrown so aggressively without quality control to meet the competition that sometimes after a security patch update a lot of glitches are observed plus the new updates need to be downloaded from my website which ruins the work culture.
‚Ä¢ All-day battery backup that‚Äôs a plus.
‚Ä¢ Stock Android Experience on the phone makes life easier.
‚Ä¢ The calling experience is above average.
‚Ä¢ The focus of the camera needs to be adjusted and optimized as the focus is lost during video recording and edges get soften up frequently.
‚Ä¢ In-display fingerprint sensor is slow and messy after a few days of use.
‚Ä¢ Customer Service is below average as the response rate is too slow
‚Ä¢ The phone is ok for day to day use and better than Redmi Note 8 pro but still just an average phone.
‚Ä¢ If considering the price you get what you pay as per current competition in the mobile market."

Xiaomi Mi A3,1,Received a defective product. Now having to go through the painful replacement process.,"Received a defective one. Just used 5 mins the screen went blank. And now the screen blinks very fast now and then. Not able to use it for last couple of days. Requested for replacement. Awaiting for response. It is huge inconvenience.
The delivery guy came to pickup the replacement after few days, but refused to pick up and handover the replacement. He was instructed to pick up only if display was working, for a phone with display issue!!! So frustrated with all these. Talked to customer support person and senior manager to help escalate and resolve this.
Will review further based on replacement."

Xiaomi Mi A3,5,The best for the price.,"Nothing but good things to say about this phone. All things considered with the price of around 12000 INR, the phone is an absolute value for money.
The display despite being 720p is super crisp.
The camera performance is surprising.
The battery backup is more than sufficient.
My favorite thing about the device is the stock android which makes everything feel smooth and fast.
P.S.
- use a good quality screen protector since it interferes with the in- display fingerprint scanner.
- gcam mod will change your camera experience forever ( in a very good way)
If youre on a budget, go for this phone. You will not regret it."

Xiaomi Mi A3,1,why you should not buy mi a3,"first of all i am not a kind of guy who put a review online , i am mostly a reader only . but sometimes product quality is so low it is just unbearable and uncompramisable for you and you just couldnt reseist sharing your feeling , so mi a3 it has worst display ever , it does not show true colors , life if you open your picture your face will look red . no one has red faces . it has very dark colors . secondly it has screen resolution of 720 pixel only , even mi a2 had 1080 pxl resolution. but in this mi a3 mobile you will not be able to see clearly , you will not be able to read texts clearly , your eyes will hurt . believe me if you care for your eyes dont buy this phone .
secondly those who dont know it has navigation buttons in opposite way , like back button is on the left side . you will have hard time getting your hand habitual to it . what i am gonna do with good battery backup and awesome camera if i cant see or read properly with this 3rd class worst display .
i got this and it still is in return period but amazon will not return and refund because they say it does not has any fault . i guess i am gonna have to sell it on olx at a big loss , atleast it will be someone elses problem now , not mine anymore. hands down to mi a3 dont buy."

Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Value for money,"Awesome combination of specs.
Go for it if looking for budget feature pack phone with stock Android. OS is pretty good and receives updates every month which is awesome! Processor and RAM are enough to lift day to day applications and mild gaming. Great Camera and good Battery life. While it comes with AMOLED display which is quite impressive and saves a lot of battery, but still Full HD display could have provided much better experience. 4000mah Battery last for the day with 8hr+ onscreen time
Finger print scanner is not that sensitive, I have added multiple scans of same finger to make it work smoothly, which is needed to be improved by Xioami.
Overall, a value for money product! Been using it for last 3 months."

Xiaomi Mi A3,3,Good Performance Good Grip & Size No Lag BUT Selfie Cam Has NO Flash & Fingerprint Lock is Slow,"Good Performance Good Grip & Size No Lag BUT Selfie Cam Has NO Flash & Fingerprint Lock is Slow
I own an A2 6/128 GB black & now i have white A3 6/128 GB variant.
Both are same..... almost.
A3 appears to be slightly thicker than A2 has a somewhat better display crispiness.
Call Quality is better than A2 (A2 is also good)
Now all good points are listed in the description
What you need to be careful about while purchasing.
A3 does NOT have a front flash LED for cam instead the screen goes white and provides luminescence. A2 has both side cam LED flash
A3 has a good hand held size and you instantly feel that how big sized phones are useless unless you want a big screen.
No lag in performance.
Battery lasts one full day and almost evening on bluetooth on, location on and data on with fit bands connected & more than moderate usage.
Display needs to be kept at max when you go out.
So when buying A2 or A3 :
A2 has flash both cams & super fast fingerprint.
A3 is sleek perfect hand held device good voice and call quality BUT no selfie flash and fingerprint takes full 1 to 1.4 second to dressup and open.
If you want fast unlock and selfie cam go for A2.
Else if you want same thing without too much big size perfect size better battery go for A3."

If Acko does not cover screen damage insurance for MI phone, then why do Amazon sell this insurance as an add on to the mobile on their website.

Xiaomi Mi A3,4,"Fast Device, good battery life and decent camera","The device is well made, gives at least 2 days back up, in screen finger scanner works well, picture quality is decent.
Best of all compared to Nokia (HMD) 6.1Plus, find Mi A3 device to be way better in terms of battery, device finish, over all experience etc. The device protection cover supplied with device fits well and looks sleek.
Both being stock android devices, Mi A3 works much better and responses are faster.
HMD Nokia 6.1 plus is a poorly made device, with low quality components, USB charging slot in Nokia 6.1Plus started giving trouble within 6 months.
Shame on HMD for using NOKIA name but not living up to the quality standards of original nokia.
Mi A3 is the go to device for Stock Android."

Xiaomi Mi A3,3,Slowest phone in this range.,"The phone is vey slow. Finger print sensor and face unlock is very bad, so i recommend not to buy it. No other reason to like it."

Best of all xiaomi with Android one, neat n no ads."

Xiaomi Mi A3,2,Proximity sensor,Does not have a proximity sensor. when you make/ answer a call the screen will remain on
Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Okay,The fingerprint sensor is worst thing about it .... otherwise it is very quality phone
Xiaomi Mi A3,4,Mi a3 honest review,Nice phone
Xiaomi Mi A3,3,Slower phone,Finger print reader is good and camera quality is Best but  picture take a slower and battery life is normal
Xiaomi Mi A3,1,Worst Xiaomi Service,"Used only two months phone was good,  some drops of water entered into my packet while riding bike,  and phone touch partially blocked.  Gone MI store they denied warranty and hasn't rectified my mobile,  and asked for 6000 ( phone cose 12000)  in order to change touch panel also conveyed me to wait for 1week and charged amount even phone hasnt rectified. Worst after sale service ( inside Mi store they mentioned #1 After sales service). WASTED 12000 FOR JUST 2 MONTHS"
Xiaomi Mi A3,4,Good mobile with worst finger print scanner,Fingerprint scanner is not up to the mark
Xiaomi Mi A3,5,A Phone worth buying!,"I went for the Mi A3 mainly because of it being a Stock Android phone.
This phone is packed with some great specs!
Firstly, I love photography and to be honest I fell in love with the camera! The wide angle lens really does a good job.
Secondly, the battery. Even though it doesn't have a 5000mAh battery but the battery doesn't drain out that quick. It gives a day's worth of charge so I don't have to worry about the charge at all.
The last feature of the phone I love is the built or the size of the phone! It's so handy and it can easily be used single handed.
I would definately recommend this product."
Xiaomi Mi A3,5,üòÅ,Great
Xiaomi Mi A3,1,Worst displaying pixels quality,Please no one buy this mobile if you dont want a headache or eye problems
Xiaomi Mi A3,4,Genuine review,"Review after 2 month usage ..
Who love Android one please go for it. There is no any Smartphone better then this device.. Camera quality is natural..
Battery life also good.
There is issue with fingerprint. It could be better after update."
Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Overall it is a good product.,Camera and bettry quality is good on this price segment.
Xiaomi Mi A3,1,Fake Promises were made by Xiaomi,"At the time of launch they said they'll give Android 10 update. But it's been 4 months and they haven't provided the update whereas Nokia, Realme, Motorola, Samsung is giving Android 10 update to their budget devices. It's a shame Xiaomi."
Xiaomi Mi A3,1,Defective piece received,Worst product in series.. Previously i had mi a1 which was of good camera quality and for that I purchased imi a3 2 days ago and it doesn't work properly .Rear camera works worst than 6 mp camera. Front camera is better than rear camera
Xiaomi Mi A3,1,Bad,Bad very bad
Xiaomi Mi A3,4,Good,I disliked this color
Xiaomi Mi A3,4,Good,Good product but easy to get scratch on the screen. Use screen guard before using
Xiaomi Mi A3,3,amazing,Good in mid range
Xiaomi Mi A3,3,Make it more efficient,"It's may more efficient & powerful, battery 5000 mAh is necessary"
Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Best Google pixel Alternative,This is the best Google pixel alternative every Google phone features with great battery life excellent camera and best performance in this price range
Xiaomi Mi A3,4,Good Mobile,Not as per the expectations
Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Superb,Very good Mobile at offrdable price
Xiaomi Mi A3,4,Good for Basic Android users and can live with some device lags,Fingerprint reader is a bit slow and has improved after the recent update. SD665 is a bit old as the lag is sometimes visible .. i wish they had used a SD710 chip. Color saturation needs further work and has to be fine tuned. Batfey life is good. I like the fast charging Speed after latest update. Audio jack is welcome but no option to select or configure the Bass treble etc
Xiaomi Mi A3,5,A3 at its best.,People who are willing to have stock Android with premium looks .  This is the phone you must buy without any hesitation.  Best mobile for casual use.
Xiaomi Mi A3,1,bad,Defective peace
Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Value for money,Good phone at this cost with a stock Android experience
Xiaomi Mi A3,1,Do Not Buy this phone,I have purchased this phone in aug 2019 but after 3 month my phone display is stop working.My phone display with black colored now.I have approached to customer care but they denied to cover it in warranty and its require about 5500 RS to change display.Company is providing warranty of 1 year but not any support  from MI Service center.Also as per 48MP camera result is like 12MP camera phone.Also there is no any call recording option in phone.Waste of money worth RS 13000.
Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Very nice,Camera nice battery good finger print reader just slow but mobile goood
Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Amazing phone,Just amazing
Xiaomi Mi A3,3,A little more than average,Bought this for my father .. after extensive use I can tell that I am happy to choose the 6fb version.. my friend‚Äôs 4gb version started to hang since first week. Overall good phone . Headphone output is very low. Battery charge time is decent . The best feature of this phone is battery drain time. You will never come back home with switched off phone .
Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Good,Nice to use. Good product on this price. camera quality is super. Battery life is medium. Very nice to use. small in size .easy to handle
Xiaomi Mi A3,1,Layman's Review,"I'm not that aware of the technical things in deep, but here's what i observed in a week's usage.
1. Handy
This is not a fat junky mobile, i had Galaxy S7 earlier, this is a bit bigger but easy to operate on one hand
2.Speakers
Very loud, Very good
3. Camera
Decent, AI camera is good, 48 mega pixel is only in Pro Mode. Lens is a bit wide, better than one plus 6 (not used other one plus phones)
5. Memory and Storage
Good enough for me. Phone never hangs, I frequently use google maps and android auto together and was very smooth, infact smoother than Galaxy s7. Job well done by processor and RAM
6. Battery
Decent, got close to 40 hours on medium usage. I dont play high end games, I use for browsing, navigation, entertainment
7. Looks/Weight
Looks neat and clean, Little heavy but very well built body
8. Others
I liked the feature of guest accounts, you can add as many as guest accounts and as many as Whatsapp accounts in each of them.
Finger print sensor is a bit slow at times, but facelock was good. As I have work profile, I always prefer screenlock (my job is a little sensitive doesn't want to expose anything and be in trouble)
There are other good features like limiting phone usage, monitoring usage etc. Overall pretty nice phone. Better than other Mi phones as this one is loaded with a clean OS. I would say best midrange phone. (I selected thois over Moto one Action, Realme XT, Sammsung A50)
Update: After 12 days
---------------------------
Fingerprint scanner stopped working. It proved a Chinese made phone. I regret this purchase. Return window is over"
Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Good,All is good
Xiaomi Mi A3,4,good but now Samsung is giving better choice,"good phone, but now realme and samsung are giving better options. for non branded ppl they can look for Realme and for ppl not Interested in chinese phones can go with Samsung...which is brandwise far better choice"
Xiaomi Mi A3,4,Supeb piece,Really good mobile.
Xiaomi Mi A3,1,Useless product,"This product has severe software problem, useless product,......"
Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Nice phone i am very happy,Nice product
Xiaomi Mi A3,4,Best Compact Android One,"I directly jump for pros and cons......
Pros.....
1. Great design ...both side Gorilla glass 5 and also camera is protected by Gorilla glass 5... Also the build quality is very solid..
2. Great camera... 48 megapixel rear Sony IMX586 sensor... Great output... And if you paired it with GCam, the camera will give insane pictures. 32 megapixel front camera is also very good. For this MIA3 the stock camera post processing is also good.
3. Battery backup is also good, and also it support quick charge 3.0.
4. Sound quality for the headphone is good and also the speaker is above average.
5. Compact size 6.01 inch SuperAmoled display.
6. The biggest pros is Google Android One.... Clean smooth stock Android..
7. Performance is ok type... or I can say average for normal user.....You can play pubg for 1 hour to 2 hour... the phone feels snappy because of the UFS 2.1 storage.
Cons....
1. Display is HD+ ... If you are coming from a full HD display mobile, you can see & feel the difference.
2. Under display fingerprint scanner is not so good.. Very slow... Ok ok type...
3. No triple slot. So I cannot use the micro SD card with two sims.
4. No fast charger supplies in the box. You have to purchase from outside if you want fast charge for your MIA3...
Overall, if you want a very good Android one device form a trusted brand, you can definitely go for the MI A3 because of having very good camera quality and display quality and also the build quality is very very premium..."

The in display fingerprint scanner , 48 mp triple rear camera,32 mp front camera , Android one , 4gb ram , 64gb rom and 4000 mah battery are the superb specs at this price range. Only the battery drains a bit faster otherwise it's the best phone at such price range ."
Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Best Mobile under 13000,I had purchased this mobile before 2 month. It's  fine working for everything
Xiaomi Mi A3,1,BAD Camera. worse UI. UX during calls is worst. do NOT buy this phone.,this is the 1st time I bought a not so reliable phone brands i have always been using a samsung or a nokia phone. And this miA3 has totally proved me right about my apprehension. worst camera quality. pictures are extremely pixeleted. they blur out even in normal mode. very very bad camera quality. worst UI. while receiving calls it gives me random errors. while on a call randomly mute or loudspeaker or any other buttons get activated. super orritating phone it is. only good thing is a super battery life. so its nothing more than 2k worth phone fr its battery life.
Xiaomi Mi A3,1,Important,The phone is not at all working properly. Many issues have been faced. Hope Amazon sees it and allows return

Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Please update fingerprint densor,Fingerprint need to update
Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Good,Sometime fingerprints not work and camera quality at night not good
Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Worth,Very nice
Xiaomi Mi A3,1,Xiaomi are cheaters,"No android 10 update yet.
Bug in proximity sensor, auto brightness and finger print sensor. Waste of money. I wish i could return my phone.
Better to go for Nokia instead for stock android lovers."
Xiaomi Mi A3,2,Dull display,The display is pathetic and very dull only way to use it is by unclicking the automatic brightness control and using it at high brightness levels manually. Bought this phone seeing that it offers AMOLED display but very disappointed to the see the dull screen which will make you run for your specs all time....
Xiaomi Mi A3,3,Good,Good phone
Xiaomi Mi A3,1,Slow unreliable fingerprint scanner,"Everything is good about the phone except the fingerprint sensor works only once out of 5 time really unreliable and annoying,don't buy this phone if you like speed and could get easily annoyed by the fingerprint sensor"
Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Slow camera,Slow for capturing images..

Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Best mobile i have ever use,"One of d best phone by mi.i was using Mi A1 since 2 years. This is far ahead than that.
Only one drawback is HD+ display but thanks to AMOLED screen it covers the gap.."
Xiaomi Mi A3,4,Perspectives of a Casual user,"I have really enjoyed using Mi A3 so far... Fingerprint scanner is kinda Meh... Works 6-7 out of 10 times, But I liked its position...
The build quality is amazing, feels completely premium and solid... Buttons are clicky
I have enjoyed using Amoled display (a first for me), and honestly I am not really bothered by 720p Resolution. My previous phone had 340 ppi screen... Mi A3 has 286ppi... But you will definitely notice the drop in resolution while playing games.
The Camera has been great, portrait mode works well, selfies are genuinely great.
Games like shadow gun legends lag even at low settings, smaller titles like WCC2 and Dream League football work well.
Battery life has been good so far, 2 days of light usage. Charging speed is okay
I liked stock android but xiaomi has cut down so many settings... No option to enable 3 button layout, no ambient display, No gestures, no proper dark mode.
Speakers are loud, ear piece is also decent.
Finally I want to say, if you are hungry for specs dont choose this phone, if you are into heavy gaming don't choose this phone, if you like a lot of software features like dual apps don't buy this one.
Thanks, I hope this was helpful."

Xiaomi Mi A3,2,Camara quality is not good,Not better camera quality
Xiaomi Mi A3,2,Some updates required,"Double Tab for screen lock,Camera picture quality.no fast charging no dual app"
Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Great Phone in 13k range,"Great hardware features + stock Android experience = MI A3
The camera is very good as can be seen from the pics. Front and Back, both cameras have high quality sensors.
Speaker is very loud and phone can be easily heard. Due to stock android the UX is really clean and enjoyable. Battery and Ram management is also superb. The AMOLED screen along with google's optimizations easily gives very long battery time. The fingerprint sensor is a bit slow due to being inside the screen. The screen aspect ratio is 13:6 so the phone can easily be held in one hand. The minimum brightness is one of the downsides, as its not dim enough for night scrolling, but you'll get used to it. The box comes with 10W charger but the device supports 18W fast charging, so buy a 18W fast charger to charge your device superfast. One thing I did note is that the sim options is hybrid, so Sim + Sim or sdCard + Sim, which is a pretty common setup, but if you choose sdCard + Sim, then the sim is inserted in slot2, not slot1 ,which seemed odd, as if you only have one sim in your phone it should be in slot 1. But that doesn't affect anything its not a downside.
Overall a great product for 13k rupees"

Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Read this before buying ******,"Is one of the best phones price / performance, don't stop buying this phone just because people says that is HD+ (720p), iPhone XR has a 720 display and it is not AMOLED.
The Xiaomi Mi A3 has:
*PRO'S*
1. Good triple set up cameras
2. Construction materials
3. One of the best batteries on the market
4. Decent in display finger print reader ( it is not slow, but there are faster ones, tip use the face unlock feature, it is a life saver ).
5. Android one and an amazing performance
6. A really good panel with nice colors but... ( This one is also a con)
CON'S*
1. Fast charging power brick not included in the box
2. The screen is 720p so pixel are noticeable, the maximum bright is not as bright as I would like to, the screen is watchable at daylight don't get me wrong, but I had higher expectations due the minimum bright is kind of high.
3. Speakers are loud and clear at 70 - 80 % however when reaches 100 % get distorted a little bit.
4. A very slippery phone (careful with that, use the included cover PLEASE )"

Xiaomi Mi A3,4,My Experience after 3 months...,"I have been using this for almost 3 months.... Battery life is great. Camera is very much impressive on this price if you want to increase the picture quality you can also use gcam mod...  Compact and the design is the main highlight and i love it.... Done some gaming on this like PUBG and it handles smoothly without issue... In screen fingerprint is not much faster but it can be reliable and it is common for this price because no one gives in display fingerprint at this price.... The quality of the video is impressive but the resolution only la let down here... And one more thing is that it receives security updates at regular intervals... Overall it is a good compact, impressive camera, good performance and good display picture quality... Only downside is its 720p resolution which I noticed only a very few scenarios... A very good budget mobile if stock android, design, camera, screen quality and good performance..."

Xiaomi Mi A3,2,No Worth of Money,"I have purchased Mi-A3 4GB during Diwali sale.
Mobile look was awsome and sleek but if you check for performance its not giving worth for the money spent.
Onscreen Finger printer will never read your finger; I tried multiple times by adding new finger templates but failed everytime.
Face detection doesn't work during Low Light, when you wore cap or sun glasses.
Night Time Photography is poor.
and the biggest shocked I received; when the mobile phone fall down from my hand for first time and screen broke from bottom even when tampered glass is fixed; so  zero marks for durability. I need to spend more Rs.5000 to repair screen for my new mobile.
It is advisable to check for other mobile models on this price range."

Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Good phone,Very nice phone I am happy with it
Xiaomi Mi A3,5,I prefer this and I'm sure Never thought for another product,"I feel very comfort with this mobile, and it has security levels high, simply fits in hand and operating very comfortable..
I am sure you surprise battery life and camera quality of this product... Fingerprint design cool ...
When we are in online contineously the battery backup comes above 12 hours sure..."
Xiaomi Mi A3,5,A better option in 20k brackets,"The fingerprint sensor is relatively slower in comparison to all other options available at all budget segment, feels slim and comfortable in hands, software experience is flawless as of this android one, camera app is average but hardware has much greater potential in it which is bottlenecked by mi's puckish camera app, 6 gb varient is fast enough to handle any task daily or processor draining, battery life is relatively better than other options in this budget bracket.
Overall if you are planning to buy a phone under 20k it is a good option to consider."

Xiaomi Mi A3,3,Review after using 1 month,"Overall its an okok phone. Not as good as Mi A1. Camera is quiet good works well in low light. Fingerprint is upto the mark..its  slow and sometimes doesn't work if screen is dusty. Coming to battery life...its a beast in Battery performance. Size of the phone is small compared to Mi A1. The worst thing i felt is the navigation options. Back key is on left side and on middle there is home/recent apps key(2 in 1). Sliding up the home key will open recent apps and clicking the home key will get back you to home screen. I would love if there were 3 keys. Dual apps mode is not given. Back design is awesome, the rainbow colour looks great. Gaming experience is worst. Pubg is playable only in Smooth mode..otherewise it starts lagging. NOT A PHONE FOR GAMER. I would give 3.5 stars out of 5 stars."

Xiaomi Mi A3,4,Okayishly good but Not great!,"I'm not happy with the security features, and the camera is okayish! But google camera port could do way better than the stock camera.
In display Fingerprint sensor is a disappointment! Too sluggish.
But the user interface is awesome.. i chose mi a3 just because of its software. Stock android is much better. Im really happy with the software.
Battery life is good. It lasts almost a day!
The main con is security. Face lock is too bad. Its Rubbish. Because they're just taking a photo of our face and making it as face lock..  its a big disappoinment. Any one can unlock the phone by just showing it a picture of us from another phone or something.
Display is good. It doesnt feel like its only hd+  (720p)display. Because amoled does better job.
Software is the only thing that does a great job. Easy to use an so!."

The camera is excellent. Very easy to install gcam, which gives great results (i used the parrot edition from xdadevelopers)

Xiaomi Mi A3,2,Confused between Note Pro and A3?,"So, a much hyped and reviewed phone, that i think is extremely primitive and fails to deliver on all its promises. I have been using this phone for a little over a month and i am ready to talk about it.
Let's begin with it's form. Looks like a 5 year old design.
Interface - from the thick ancient font to silly round folders, this one looks like the first generation smartphone. Even Taking a screenshot is such a tedious task.
Camera - Mega pixels is a farce. There is hardly any pixel depth. You can't even zoom in 10% on the photo you've taken. The quality of image sucks. Finding focus is another issue. Image correction has limited tools.
From a non functional fm radio to low ability to capture signals amd internet, i am yet to find one good thing about this phone.
Please please go for the redmi note series if you arr confused between the two. My sister has one. The tech reviewers should be sp@#*&ed for recommending this over Note pro 7.
Atleast the display, interface and user experience is up to date and looks like a contemporary phone."
Xiaomi Mi A3,4,Great buy,Great phone for an average user. I don't game much but it handles casual games easily. The most important aspect that I like is the one handed use of the phone. The form factor is really great

yes the battery life is good no need to charge daily even if you use for music ,for watching videos you can still go for one and a half day without fully charging again
only disadvantages when you are seen your screen in fully sunny day you might not able to see the the matter on the screen clearly I don't know maybe it is because of the amoled screen or is it some thing else the brightness is low when you are using your phone in bright sunny day.
music quality is ok compared to other redmi phones

Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Saste me sabse Badhiya,"Mi A3 has all the best features that any modern android phones should have. For minimum budget it's a perfect fit. All the phones life is 2 years as in that period of time a new feature will come so it's wiser to spend less money and enjoy same facilities.

Still the battery performance is poor. If you switch on the Battery saver option then the battery will run 35-40hrs if full charge. Sound and Camera quality is good enough. You can not save your contacts in your device. It will save to Google or Mi account. Size is quite handy. Out of 10, I will give 6 to this handset."

Prefer Redmi Note 8, Note 8 Pro or Realme 5 or pro if stock Android is not the reason behind choosing Mi A3.
If someone has done the mistake of buying this phone. I'm sure you're angry on it's blurry camera. Please search yourself a ""Google camera mod"" that can be installed on Mi A3. It works wonder for it."

I don't have time to run behind all this stuff üò£ before this phone i already returned k8 Lenovo. It's disappointing to see problematic phones in Amazon store. I hope Amazon looks into it.
To mi company my review is that the phone Lacks some more basic things such as dual app, secure zone and of course call history. I can see person has called me 5min back but I can't see when before 5 min they have called. To be More specific , per contact call history is not recorded with past timestamps, it doesn't show history of caller when else they called us."

. Ear speaker is poor , other is good .
. Contact and logs are simply pathetic , you can't see recent used number ( if contact has more than one like in note series).

Xiaomi Mi A3,1,Horrible customer support of Amazon,"This phone is a crying shame. One day after buying the phone, the call log wasn't opening, couldn't make calls, the camera kept on getting hung, finger print is so slow that I would rather put the password. Also, there isn't a single day when the phone won't get hung. Moreover, the customer support has deteriorated. I had called Amazon over 10times to help me replace the phone but nobody helped, even when they did they ended up booking the technician visit for an entirely different day and then they didn't even rectify there mistake. I wish I could have given a zero rating to the phone and a negative rating to the horrible customer support provided."

Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Mi A3 Review,Can improve more in fingerprint reader.
Xiaomi Mi A3,4,Ok purchase,Back camera are ok but results not so fine in low  light
Xiaomi Mi A3,5,Greatest Mid range Stock android phone,"Only con about this phone is the fingerprint reader. Otherwise the phone is best. Awesome stock and slick android with regular updates. Yes, you can still notice pixels due to hd resolution of the display but super amoled makes up for most of it. Battery life is awesome. In medium use can easily last 1 day with charging next morning. If light use, then it can easily last 2 days. Adaptive battery is great feature. You have to buy an 18W fast charger then you are all set. It takes few minutes more than an hour to charge fully. Definitely better rha Nokia options in mid range budget."

My previous MiA1 had an excellent and very responsive fingerprint reader. This one works only 1/10 times. Also, as with the previous MiA1 phone, the display gets switched on while on a call and multiple keys gets pressed."

Xiaomi Mi A3,4,Good phone from Xiaomi but.....,"The overall experience of this phone is very good.
camera is quite efficient and it captures some good snaps even in low light. The battery life is also decent. A full charge lasts for about day and a half. The look and build quality is also good for its price, having said that the back glass of the phone broke at one fall only. The service centre is now asking for 2k to change the back panel. This arises a question in my mind whether to use a glass body phone or a metallic one?"

My MI A3's screen automatically stopped working on 8th day of purchase without any sort of physical or liquid damage. Visited nearby service centre, they officially assured me a fix in 5 days but they will try to fix in 3 days. Instead of 5 days they called me after a week and handed me a phone with broken back panel (remember I have submitted a brand new MI A3 with screen not responding but without any physical or liquid damage). "" Sir, here is your mobile with screen issue fixed "". They were handing over me a working phone with back panel broken - as if nothing has happened. I was shocked!!! After my objection, they accepted that their guys broke my phone's back panel.
Now on top of already a weeks delay for screen issue, they asked 3 more days for fixing broken back panel.
On 4th November, submitted my phone and today on 17th November, my phone's still in service centre.

Display: 3.5/5 good bright AMOLED display. Vibrant colour. Notice lack of resolution only when viewing high definition picture or video.
Camera: 4.5/5 . The 48 mp camera is a killer when coupled with GCAM mod. Ultrawide angle camera quality is acceptable but not very good. Front camera performance is decent.
Battery life: 4/5 good for single day heavy usage. Charging is fast.
Finger print reader: 2/5 On screen fingerprint reader is a big miss. Too slow and irresponsive.
SOC: 4/5 good enough for day to day usage. Can't make comment about gaming performance. No heating issue is there.

Xiaomi Mi A3,3,Full review after two weeks of usage,"I went ahead with this product because it was associated with android one program and had a decent battery life. After 2 weeks of usage, this is the summary.
1. Great battery life:(8.5/10)
I can easily get a day and a half to two days on this guy. I do a bit of gaming, YouTube, social media. Games run smooth, you don't have to worry about the SD 665. I bought the 18W charger( the charger in unit is 10W) and I wasn't satisfied. It takes 2 hours to full charge. It's acceptable because the battery is a massive 4000 mAh but I expected more from the charger.
2. Display:(7/10)
Coming from a 1080p phone, I am not disappointed. WE REALLY CANT DISTINGUISH A 720p PANEL FROM A 1080p. If that's your deal-breaker, don't worry. Under normal conditions, the display is beautiful. A bit saturated, but you get used to it quickly. However, it's not the brightest panel and under the sun, it can get really dim. Also, in dark conditions, it is brighter. Another thing I noticed is that the auto brightness sensor is not great, it can get brighter than needed to be or dimmer.
3. Software:(9/10)
Android one, need I say more? Android 9 is great, and I have got a couple of security updates, so far so good. Everything is very smooth and seamless, although android 10 hasn't dropped yet.
4. Camera:(8/10)
It's a surprise! The normal lens, 2x lens can take some very good photos for this segment. The wide angle lens gives you options, but you can't expect good detail. The night mode is better than nothing, but that's all is there to say about it.
5. Gaming:(7.5/10)
Games run good. No lag, no heating issues. Although, this phone isn't optimised for gaming.
5. Other stuff:(5/10)
The auto brightness sensor is a bit of a let-down. The auto-rotate sucks. It gets pretty annoying while watching YouTube. Unlike other mi devices, this doesn't have the infrared sensor. I have mixed reactions about the speaker. It is loud, but gets blurry, so I always have to go down 2 points. The haptic feedback was a sweet surprise! Feels very good. The fingerprint sensor is slow, and misses a few. I thought it will be bearable, but it gets annoying coming from a physical fingerprint sensor. And face unlock is just a gimmick.
Overall, I am satisfied with the product but if you can push up your budget a little, there are lot of better options available. Or, if you could hang with your phone for some more time, do so. Or, if you don't really mind the software experience, you have better options available.
7/10 phone, a decent phone from Xiaomi."

Xiaomi Mi A3,4,After  20 days using - honest review,"Using over 20+ days and installed 100+ apps and truly speaking, it‚Äôs still runs as smooth as butter. Not a single lag faced yet. Camera is ""thik thak"" . Selfie is awesome truly. Finger print sensor is too low. (Don't know why that damn doesn't capture my GF's fingerprint. Every time I put that and every time that thing doesn't capture this and I had to face her with lots of doubtfulness üôÑ) Really, after using a protective screen guard, the sensor runs slowly. It's really feels not good. Battery backup is too high. Really! And the charging time? Oh god! It's too quick. In a snap (not thanos's üòÑ) it's charged and after getting a 100% battery on morning at 6 am, close your eyes - THE MI A3 is running approx 6 pm with heavy using. Though I don't play pubg that's why can't write about that thing. But still I didn't faced a single or half or mini or micro lag at all.
Overall it's really a great choice."

Vivo V17 Pro,5,Good Phone to have if you are not using android auto heavily,"Overall i liked the phone and its usage. Only one problem which is causing a big pain is the Android auto with google maps on my car is not working for me. Android auto with google maps start up and then hangs up after 2 min. After that android auto is unusable. My previous phone used to work fine with android auto. Till now not able to figure out any solution. So thats why 3 ratings otherwise i would have given all 5 ratings for this phone. Battery etc, usage wise its pretty good. If you are not using android auto then its a good phone to have. sleek design, camera pop up, camera usage all are perfect.
Dec-7 update: After struggling a lot figured out that there is a settings->battery->High background power consumption. Here enable Android Auto. Now Android auto works perfectly fine. Hence providing 5 ratings"

Vivo V17 Pro,5,An all rounder phone. In terms of specifications and features. And a value to money product.,"A superb product. A value for money product. I got it for 19,500/- only (Glacier White, 8gb ram, 128gb storage) in exchange of Vivo V11pro. Everything is best about the product till date, including Camera, Classy look, Processing, Storage, Gaming, etc. But a little disadvange is that it only has in-display fingerprint sensor, if the fingerprint isn't correct for 3 consecutive times, then the front camera pops up and face unlock works. But the fingerprint works pretty fast for me. If you are looking for ideal Android phone within the price range, it's probably the best compared to Oppo, Xiaomi, etc brands. Also the 2nd best Android phone after OnePlus 7T in all range."

Vivo V17 Pro,2,Not a good quality product,"Hi,
I bought this phone today and i was lucky to receive it the today itself.
I immediately started experiencing this phone as it comes from the same family as of 1+
I'm seriously disappointed with this phone, the display quality is not good, the camera per specification would be 32MP but the actual output is around 8MP. User experience of this OS is pathetic. To my understanding it not worth the price. I would prefer Samsung M30 over this phone.
I'm disappointed with this product.
Thanks

Vivo V17 Pro,5,Superb Phone... (Read my full Review),"Camera Superb, 48mp individual setting for extra clear pic., 4k recording is awesome.. the pic size in normal mode is 6528x2944pixel and takes 4.5mb in each photo. And the pic size in 48mp is 8000x6000pixels and takes 11.14mb each pic.. Dual front is Nice and trendy.. I thought that it will not give desired speed in gaming as it has old chipset but it was quite surprised to say that the phone is Excellent for Gaming too.. There is a Ultra Gaming mode facillity given in the mobile that smoothens your experience for gaming. In some more features it has given kids mod that too is awesome.. thanks vivo for keeping the settings of mobile too simple.. touch is super fast with having great display pixel of Super Amoled Display. The super saver feature is copied from my Vivo V7+, The only Con I see is the dual sim slot... As hybrid slot is expected in this Price set phone.. Internal Memory and Ram is Sufficient for all our work.. Overall I Give 5 Star for Fast Charging..its 18w Fast Charging Support in this Mobile Through Which the Mobile is Charged 5% to100% in 1.2hrs. battery given is 4100mah which is Non Removable. Fingerprint given in thos phone is Biometric and highly secure with 95% accuracy. I Recommend this to Everyone.. Go For it if You Want Premium Quality Phone. I Truly Explored and Loved this Phone. All the Best..

OPPO F11,1,Not worth buying,"I was using a Motorola phone since last 3 years. Now I thought of switching to OPPO (however I never trust this brand) but I am not at all satisfied with the processor and it's performance. It's a brand new phone which gets hanged a number of times a day. The description said it's front camera is 48MP (I have the screenshots) however what I received has only 16MP front camera. Amazon misguided me. Don't go for OPPO, just go for Motorola or Redmi."

OPPO F11,5,Wow what a phone....butter smooth 6gb ram,"Let me tell you i upgraded from iphone 6 to Oppo f11 and i do not regret at all...what a top class mobile with more features than ios.
Front camera is simply awesome....
For Back camera the best part is night mode...
UI is great and the screen is bright as Amoled i mean although it is not Amoled like Samsung but the clarity is greater than Samsung M30
Battery lasts for 2 days with heavy use ....0-100% in 45 minutes.....
No heating at all while playing PUBG or Charging....i picked this phone over Redmi note 8 because Redmi has lot of heating issue.
Processor is definitely faster than Samsung M30 series, so cant even compare them in terms of speed, one can simply check youtube videos online for speed comparison.
PUBG runs smooth on medium graphics. Go for 6GB RAM if you want butter smooth experience.
i believe oppo mobiles are more reliable than samsung or xaomi, as this is my second OPPO mobile in the family and is more than  2 years"

OPPO F11,3,Camera and display are not good.,Samsung camera is better than this.
OPPO F11,4,"Blazing fast !! Slick, good battery life, excellent quality","This is a review after owning the phone for 24 hours.
I am very very happy! It has exceeded all of my expectations! An amazingly wonderful device.. user friendly, application friendly...
It was exactly the same, came before time with its accessories (earplugs and charger) and I was surprised cause it also came with a clear cover, thou, this one's not really protective, so if you're as sloppy as I am I'd recommend to buy another. But I totally appreciate the intention and also, I'm using it. Amazing Camera which I didn't expect. I am solid fan of Huawei/Honor phones but decided to try this brand, though my one colleague friend has one.
But here are the basic pros and cons:
Pros:
o Beautiful design that stands out.
o Notch display design allows for a high screen to body ratio and more usable screen area on a  compact body.
o It looks great and feels premium
o It has a decent screen with high resolution display.
o I have no problem viewing it in sunlight.
o Good tactile feel of buttons.
o Quick and accurate fingerprint scanner.
o Good cameras.
o Very strong CPU performance.
o Good battery life & Very fast charging.
o Calls are clear and loud. Other features like texts and data all work well
Cons: Glass back is more prone to damage, necessitates extra careful handling or use of protective cases. No water resistance. Single band WiFi. Weak GPU performance. Dropping this phone without a case on it could be disastrous

OPPO F11,4,Good phone at a budget range...6gb ram and 128 gb space,Overall experience is good...Back camera while set to 48 MP is exceptionally great in daylight....night mode is also worthy just lack of details and sharpness...selfie camera is also good at this range....wide angle is missing though....screen display is also fine but not as great as super amoled....music and sound quality is a let down here...battery life is also good 1.5 days at moderate to heavy usage...what I have faced as an issue is the processing performance of this performance as it takes a lot of time opening apps or websites...

OPPO F11,4,Good but not Best.,It's just my overview. Phone is quite good but not up to mark. We can't say it is a best one. Some quality is good but if you used iPhone versions or Samsung versions then somewhere it make you feel something different experience. There should be guide via that we can manage our phone till best level. Bluetooth and calculator is not as much important to give in top setting. At that place there should be hotspot and kids space. Rest buy and post your experience.

OPPO F11,4,Superb Phone which can be improved,"Amazing phone! But the camera app could be better. There are very few customizations in the camera app. Also some minor glitches in ColorOS 6 which can be fixed by updates. Was expecting a triple camera setup at this price, but the 48 mp camera makes up for it. Average gaming performance, but battery consumption increases greatly while playing. Very heavy and thick, and was expecting a larger battery for that weight. VOOC fast charging is superb, just takes 1 hour to charge fom 0-100%.Camera is superb. Unfortunately no 4k recording option. Again, the camera app needs plenty of improvements."
OPPO F11,5,Good product,Nice phone at very good price..
OPPO F11,5,Very satisfied with my Oppo F11,"Very satisfied with Oppo F11. Initially before purchasing I verified few other mobiles with similar specifications. Oppo F11 with 6 GB RAM & 128 GB internal memory seemed as pocket friendly and good based on reviews.
After purchasing, first went for factory reset and software update. Transferred data from old mobile to new one. Once set, there was no looking back.
Excellent battery usage though the battery is only 4000 mAH. It easily runs for a day and a half. With VOOC charging, we can easily keep the mobile alive.
I haven't tried heavy apps but with longer browser usage and audio video usage I haven't observed any drag in the performance. Nice quality output of both audio and video.
Now comes the best part. The camera. Simply AWESOME. The pics shot in portrait mode are too good.
On the whole very satisfied with my Oppo F11."

OPPO F11,4,Good,Like
OPPO F11,1,Waste of money,Primary camera quality is very poor it is not 48 megapixel do not buy this phone please.  waste of money.
OPPO F11,5,Nice,Very nice mobile no issues...
OPPO F11,5,I am satisfied even though I didn't choose it for myself...üòâ,"I never really chose this phone for myself because I preferred a Samsung product but my father bought me this one anyway. As a college student, I needed it to accompany me all day while doing some continuous work thus I was looking for a Big battery phone (Samsung M30).  However, right now I have a Oppo F11 Opal Green with 6 GB RAM and 128 GB ROM (107 GB usable). It is not the Pro Variant I am glad that it isn't.
The best thing which I liked about this phone is the Battery Life/Management. I literally charge this phone once a day for about an hour which is usually when I wake up and prepare for my Lectures. The VOOC 3.0 is no joke. It works and it works well ...!  (about 30-40% in 10 minutes, maybe üòÖ)
.
I don't know much about Smartphone Cameras but It has a Dual Rear Camera which works as it should be... To capture a 48 MP image, you must change the resolution from the settings. (I can't see any difference anyway, It's always a good picture XD ).
.
I don't use this phone for gaming but it has run some apps that use 3D Models but it never heated up because of the huge amount of processing.
.
My friends and familia did like the look and colour of the phone so If you are into that kind of thing then it's all good. I personally never cared about the look.
The body is shiny as if it is a chrome plating but surprisingly, it isn't slippery (Which is a huge problem for me).
.
The VOOC Charger is something to keep for yourself because it seems like a new technology which is somewhat like an upgrade to micro USBs Cable Charging (Same USB port). I dunno if it better than the USB C type or why Oppo chise to go with this one.
.
Overall, If you just need a phone between 15k-20k, this one is not a bad choice (nor the best one either...). You can find a lot of better/similar phone providing more within the same price. But this one is thumbs up from me. Don't go for the Pro, The Pop up camera isn't worth it because you won't get the same amount of storage for a reasonable price.
Anyway, thanks for reading this looong review...I wish you luck and I hope that you become satisfied with whatever product you buy ...üòä"

OPPO F11,5,Great phone and Camera does wonders!,"Great phone, amazing camera, not the best at 48MP, but better performance in portrait and night shots compared to Vivo and even Samsung at this price range.
huge space 128GB means I get to store a lot of camera images/ WhatsApp content without thinking of running out of memory.
Only Cons -
No wide angle camera/ AI feature given.
Larger battery could have been offered, still take me though the day and a half with normal use, Note- Gaming drains it very quickly!"

OPPO F11,5,Beast of a Phone,"Oppo F11 Pro is easily the best looking phone in this segment, and it's packing a great camera... Get the Oppo F11  if you're a sucker for looks and appreciate a great display and a great camera..  48 MP main shotter and a 5 MP depth sensor does the trick.
# phone gives you 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage. Enough to run heavy games like PUBG.
# has a Helio P70 MediaTek SoC which is a cheaper meditek processor, if a Snapdragon 710 SoC was inside the hood this phone would have been unbeatable in this price segment.
Overall verdict.. great choice if your budget is between 17K -19K. üëç"

All facets of phone- looks, speed, ease of use, camera are top notch
Only cons is too many apps come pre installed which need to be removed as most are not needed"
OPPO F11,5,Great mobile at great price,"Purchased it for around 12k after exchange, no lag behind while playing pubg, camera is great, perform well in low light, performance is good, display is awesome, only concern is better life which drain fast, since it support fast charging it covers it drawback no issue in watching online content, there is one issue there are lots preinstalled bloatware, but what are going to do when you do have around 108 GB free ram.

OPPO F11,3,"The phone is good, but...","We bought this phone on 3rd, July, 2019 at 17,990. After almost 2 months of its usage I am listing out the below Pros and Cons:
Pros:
1. The screen quality is good
2. Battery life is also good (since its recently purchased it is good, need to see in a long run, how the battery functioning functioning would be)
3. 6+ inches and design quality are good.
Cons:
1. The primary functionality of a phone or smart phone is call quality, this parameter is not good in this phone (thats why I gave 3 stars). The other phones like Moto G are receiving the signal quality and call quality from the same Operator. But this phone is not upto the mark at this point. I have been asking my family member who are using this phone to speak loudly. They are saying like that they are speaking loudly. Songs and other audio are playing appropriately and correctly.
2.  Camera is 48MP. The photos are really good. But getting a question like these photos are really upto 48MP range?
3. The price almost 18,000 (later after I purchased it came to now 16,990) is also a questionable parameter."

I got Oppo F11 6 GB RAM 128 GB ( u get around 102 GB net of preinstalled system and other software ) memory phone for special exchange deal for around Rs13.4 K during Amazon Day sale .
Now using for more than a month . Good phone , camera, performance and battery  . Some bloatware exists which u cannot delete . Good battery life and very quick recharging . Need to be careful about permission , notification and default settings which may otherwise cause messaging and ad nuisance . Minimise it to suit your requirements .Delete the preinstalled Apps that you don‚Äôt want.
My Anti Virus Norton software constantly raises the the virus alert for the preinstalled SMS Messenger  which I cannot disable or uninstall .  Issue cannot be resolved . Living with it .
Definitely great Value for Money and performance ."

OPPO F11,2,Average phone,"Too heavy
Cheap screen guard used. Multiple scratches  in intial few hours
Charger too large to fit in normal socket or small compartment of your bag
Battery not that good and cannot be compared with lenevo anyhow
Internal software blocking BANKING apps
Why the damm u donot allow finger sensor to work after reboot. Its much safer than pattern
Doesnot allow to use certain function of icon of notification bar like bluetooth hotspot which is illogical
Cannot remove fresh n new notification in lock screen or active screen by a swipe
Even if u stop notification of what's app in settings as well as app still they show the same
On click the notification they expand n r not opened in the app
Scrolling required for adjustimg sound n brightness
Sound req more clarity
No inbuilt good ringtones. No orignal or company ringtone
This model cannot be called the best for this price range. Average value for money"

OPPO F11,5,Super moblie and increase ram,Nice mobile
OPPO F11,3,Complete review,"Well,we all know that oppo is one of the established smartphone manufacturer in India and F series has been their best midranger by far but as time changes they need to upgrade in some issues.
First we will talk about my experience of this mobile.
BUILD QUALITY:
it's good but should have been given mettalic frame,but we will get plastic and also on the back they opted glossy plastic finish not glass(that's too weird)
Soo 5/10
DESIGN:
It's has a common waterdrop notch which can be seen in almost every mid-range mobiles but has a unique and attractive look,that strikes ur eyes easily and camera bump is little bit bigger but u won't feel it when u put on the case
7/10
DISPLAY:
it has a big screen(6.5 inch) that is more than enough and also a FHD+ IPS lcd display which makes a good phone for video watching and movies and considering the price point and also the remaining  compromises in many aspects they should have opted for AMOLED screen,but not a big problem though
9/10
PERFORMANCE:
well the HELIO P70 chipset does a pretty decent job in day to day usage,gives it's best in app surfing but for gaming there the question rises,yes it's a powerful processor but for heavy games it struggles a bit,so think young fella,if u're a heavy gamer better not to choose this
7/10
SOFTWARE:
Well it depends on person to person but for people who likes heavy skin UI s COLOR OS does a pretty good job u will get most features in this UI,and not too many glitches and also runs pretty smooth which is amazing and it has the oppo HYPER BOOST technology which helps in gaming a bit,but no idea and hope about regular updates and also lacks DARKMODE
7/10
CAMERA:
This is where the oppo is targeting the buyers and has a huge remark as a camera centric specially a selfie centric,but guys hold ur nerves this mobile is not so good at selfies when compared to it's previous gen oppo mobiles like OPPO F7,F9,
but rear camera does a decent job and also hasgood dynamic range,but selfie camera is not good at all coming to video department where oppo always disaapoints me is no 4K video recording ,and not even EIS u missed them both atleast oppo should have implemented either one ,video is not great at this price point
6/10
BATTERY LIFE:
thank God this is where this mobile stands different from others at this price point,too good battery and gives u a full day and thanks to oppo VOOC charge which charges ur mobile completely in 90 minutes a great functionality
10/10
VALUE FOR MONEY:
well this is where it fall behind completely ,at 17k one will expect a better build quality
If not u should have upgrade the processor damn God mobiles below 10k are coming with P70,they should have gone with 675 or 710,if they wanna maintain the same processor they should have gone with AMOLED display so either any of the above changes is highly recommended,in order to saty and the launched K20 which is way better than this device inost aspects but why launching this if u have an idea to launch that one
OVER ALL RATING: 6/10
better go for k20"

OPPO F11,5,My vote 9/10,"First time I purchased Oppo and this phone proves the best ever. Camera is of best quality battery is also satisfactory and most importantly the fast charging.
Touch screen is also functioning in high quality.
If you are going to compare this mobile with Samsung of 25k range u must go with the Oppo f11 6gb 128gb.
My vote for this is 9/10."
OPPO F11,4,"Nice mobile for storage, front Camera, Night mode and processing","It has been 2 months now when I had purchased this mobile. It's good in camera, battery and enough storage. So previously I had issue with storage with other mobiles but now which ever app I need to install I can install that without unintallation of present app.
Pros- battery backup is up to 15 hrs in a normal use( 2 hrs YouTube,1 hr Facebook, 2 hrs map work for rides and all, and normal call and internet surfing) so think It's a good backup.
Front camera is very good with AI features. Even in a dim light it captures good pic.
Night mode is good feature so that our eyes can be safe.
Good processor speed.
Cons- sometimes I feel that touch is working slowly.
You can go for it if u r looking for good storage, battery backup, good selfies, want to use so many apps concurrently."

OPPO F11,5,Excellent machine near 12000 price!,"I purchased this phine st 11,300 through prime day sale. This is really worth the price mobile.  It is the best phone currently between 11-12k.  Its battery life is excellent.  It almost runs 24 hours,  with normal usage.  Back camera is amazing,  be it day or night it is amazing.  Front camera is also good if you consider price under 15k.The screen quality is also up to the mark. Performance wise it is not the best but at this price range it is very good. And considering the storage,  you will never fall short with 128 gb storage."

if photo / video is the primary reason in selecting a mobile.
The quad-bayer array pixel binning
it performs is effective- making a 12mp take a 48mp like image.
Comes with a fast lens- F1.8 (rear).
If your aperture is going to be fixed, it better be fast.
The still camera manual controls extend the limits of a cameraphone-
ISO, Shutter speed, Focus, Exposure compensation, Colour temperature.
It also employs various softwares for various shooting conditions.
Charges fast, drains slow. It‚Äôs always ready for work!"

Cons:
1. You can't hide the content of notifications on lock screen, i have searched a lot on internet but couldn't find any solution to that. Hope Oppo fixes that issue.
2. No USB C type charging cable, and the charging cable tip is also different from regular cables, hence have to mark for this side up.

OPPO F11,5,Value for money,"An amazing phone with amazing features smooth running with amazing clarity F11 and F11 pro are not very different just the rising camera bit is, would definately recommend"
OPPO F11,5,Best Buy,"In the present competitive market for mobile phones, OPPO F11 @ Rs.17,990/- is the best choice at least for a year. Sum of all specifications declares this is the one mobile phone fulfills almost every feature. Battery backup, Display, Color OS-6, Quick charge are fine. Comparing other P70 Processor mobile, this one is the cost effective. Realme1 not available in the market. So, this is the ultimate choice for me to avail special discounts on exchange price. I returned my HTC Desire for Rs.2500/-  . Mobile display touch itself exhibits its quality."
OPPO F11,4,Nice phone,"Over all product is good,Camera quality is good,But problem wid it is that clarity of screen is not up the the mark.I expected better clarity especially while watching videos on it,But I am disappointed wid this except this everything is Okey.."
OPPO F11,1,Worst experience,Received this phone today. Got a defective one. Phone is automatically switching off again and again despite full charge. Complete disappointment.
OPPO F11,4,Not brand new one,"Not a unboxed one. void lable opened to cover this new one pasted over the previous.
More than 6 Scratches found in Back cover."
OPPO F11,5,Very nice,Best mobile for this prize
OPPO F11,5,Goode But Cemera Note Good Quality,Ok
OPPO F11,4,Good,Good quality camera  sound
OPPO F11,5,Nice,Value for money
OPPO F11,5,King of the mid segment phones...Oppo f11,"First of all, this phone has the best battery in its class...If you keep 4g on whole day, this phone loses just 10-12 % with surfing and online videos.
I played 1 hour of pubg on high hd settings and the phone loses 13%..so it's a very well configured phone.
Next...This phone has absolutely 0 heating issues..I mean my one plus 6t heats up during dash charge but f11 won't heat at all. It goes from 1% to 100% in 1 hour 15 minutes with the phone and 4g on..
Oppo f11 has the same specifications as f11 pro..Only difference is the motorized camera and 0.2 % more screen size..And I was unwilling to sacrifice 6000 more for this little enhancement
This phone competes with redmi note 7 pro, realme 3 pro and samsung m30
And its looks and battery beats all 3 of them..Including m30's 5000 mah battery.
It has premium gradient looks, superb camera with AI setups, 128 gb memory and a display that beats all other displays mentioned above
The 4gb ram is sufficient and realme or note 7's 6gb ram is a hoax as far as its performance is considered
All these redmi and realme phones have heating issues persistent from the first day itself..
Plus oppo provides fair quality headphones with f11 that none of the above phones provide whatsoever..
The only drawback is some pre installed apps in color os 6 and no separate sd card slot..u can either use 2 Sims or 1 sim and one sd card (upto 512 gb) in it..
Overall it's the best overall phone in the below 20k segment..
N it's better than oppo f11 pro..
The only cutback is the price..Otherwise u can't chose anything between it and oppo f11 pro..."
OPPO F11,5,Very nice product,Very nice product nice came battery is too good very fast charging technology by vooc charger good phone awesome feature
OPPO F11,1,"Not worth for 17,000 Rupees","If you buying this phone due to 48MP.

OPPO F11,5,Nice phone ..,"Camera quality good.no Heating problem, battery backup good.."
OPPO F11,4,Good overall,"Phone feels a little heavy ND large to hold and keep in pocket; coming from oppo f9 I think that's understandable cause f9 is very light nd compact. But the extra screen space is obvious. Display is alright, nothing like AMOLED but for reading this is fine. Camera is good and fast. Storage of 128gb is enuf for me. Thought 4gb ram would be insufficient but experienced no lags so far. I think that's the p70 and the hyperboost effect. Battery back up and vooc charger are both good. Doesn't get too hot even with vooc. I miss phones having IR blasters these days. Screen guard and cover that come with phone are quite good. Problem is u can't get similar screen guard and cover in the market. Had the same problem with f9 too. May be oppo should do something like at xiaomi does, get their own online accessories store."

OPPO F11,5,Budget Beast,"Was looking out for a nice budget phones for my wife. Budget because, we change the phones very frequently.
Below are the options I was considering and why I didn't go for it:
1) Redmi Note 7 Pro : Obvious choice but Forever on flash sale, ran out of patience. Plus the mi ads are irritating.
2) Realme 3 Pro: Same reasons, forever on flash sale
3) Oppo K1: was somehow not convinced to go for it.
I thought of waiting for a month more till either of the phones come on 24x7 sale.
I was impressed with F11 pro, but somehow I found it way too expensive for the specs offered.
Thankfully the news of Huawei-Google came which coupled with Amazon's extra offer on exchange tempted me to go for F11.
I personally like the water drop display. The best thing about the phone is it's snappy and the camera is much better my current OnePlus 5t.
Also with the exchange offer, I got the device for around 11.5k which is way too VFM"
